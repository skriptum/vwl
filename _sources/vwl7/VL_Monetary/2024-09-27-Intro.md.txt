# Introduction to monetary Problems

> **Currency**: 
> - unit of account
> - express value of any good
> - medium of payment
> - store of value

= counterpart of legal flows

History:

- barter economy
	- needs „*double coincidence of needs*“ 
	- storage + transportation costs
- gold currency
	- large value / weight ratio
	- easily divisible
- modern banking system
	- expansion of debt+loans
	- fiat currencies

> **Exchange Rate:** projection of relative value against each other (currency pair)

- *direct* quotation: price of foreign in domestic
- *indirect* quotation: price of domestic in foreign

- *spot* exchange rate: todays prices
- *forward* exchange rate: quoted today, delivered later
	- adjusted for inflation differentials + interest rates

> **Arbitrage:** taking advantage of price differentials for same goo

= same prices = Purchasing Power Parity

$$
M_{i,j} = \frac{P_j}{P_i}
$$

- $M_{i,j}$ = exchange rate
- $P_{i},P_j$ = price levels in countries
