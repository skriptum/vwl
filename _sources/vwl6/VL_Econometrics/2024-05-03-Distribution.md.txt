## Sampling Distribution of OLS-Estimator

Assumption: 

- error $\epsilon$​​ = independent of explanatory variables
- normally distributed with mean = 0 and sd = $\sigma^2$

=> depends on empirical topic



e.g Wage regression

- wage > 0 $\neq$ normal distributed
- minimum wage => population eran exaclty minimum

=> solve with *log*

Theorem

$$
\implies \hat{ \beta_j } \sim Normal[\beta_j, Var(\beta_j)] \\
$$

 

## t-statistic

**4.2!**
