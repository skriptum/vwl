# 29.11.2023 Asymmetric Information & Social Insurance

4 Questions for public economics

- **When** intervenve?
- **How** intervene?
- **What** is the effect?
- **Why** do governments choose to intervene the way they do

## Asymmetric Information

Akerlof: Market for Lemons

- Buyer does not know the "real" value of the car
- Seller does know, mistrust

=> asymmetric information => market failure => government intervention



### Car Insurance Market

- high risk people = 5% chance of accident in year
- low risk people = 0.5% chance of accident
- cost of car accident = 30.000$

actuarially fair premiums:

- low risk: $0.005 \times 30.000 = 150$
- high risk: $0.05 \times 30.000 = 1500$

Insurance Company wiht 100 people of each group

- low risk calculation:
    - income: $150*1000 = 15.000$
    - damage payments: $30.000 \times 0.05 \times 100 = 15.000$
    - income = payment = 0 profit
- high risk similar

But: **asymmetric information!** 

- insurance company cant tell the difference
- averagy insurance premium in the middle
    - low risk people wont pay
    - high risk people will profit and drive company bankrupt



**separating equilibrium**

insurers offers two contracts

- full coverage of 30k at 1500$ premium
- partial coverage up to 10k at 50$ premium

but still market failure (financial risk persists)



### Adverse Selection

> **Adverse Selection**: market situation where buyers and sellers have different information => unequal distribution of benefits to both parties

Example: Harvard Death Spiral

2 plans of Helath insurance

- full benefits with premium
- lower benefits with no premium

in crisis, higher prices for 1., healthy people change



## Social Insurance

1. Health Insurance (1883)
2. Accident Insurance (1884)
3. Pension Insurance (1889)
4. Unemployment Insurance (1927)
5. Long-term Care Insurance (1995)

German System

- solidarity
- mandatory
- Benefit is tied to certain event (unemployment, sickness, needs care)
