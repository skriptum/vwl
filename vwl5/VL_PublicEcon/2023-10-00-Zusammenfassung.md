# Public Economics: Summary

Study of Government in our Economy

## Government Expenditure

> **Wagners Law:** Government expenditure grows not only in absolute terms, but also in relative to overall economy

Reasons:

- Fiscal Illusions
- Urbanization
- superior goods by Gov
- Baumol
- Demographic

> **Baumol Effect**: Services = more expensive than goods, Gov provides many services



## Theory of Welfare Economics

### Demand

- with indifference curves of Utility Levels
- and budget constraint

> **Marginal Utility:** increment in utility with one additional unit of good (diminishing)

> **Marginal Rate of Substitution:** Willingness to trade one good for another = Slope of IDC

Price Change Effects: Substitution / Income Effect

> **Elasticity of Demand:** % change in demand due to 1% increase in price


$$
e = \frac{ \frac{ \Delta Q }{Q} }{\frac{ \Delta P }{P}}
$$

- often negative
- if infinite = perfectly elastic demand (horizontal)
- if 0 = perfectly unelastic (vertical)



Demand for Good at Price: derived from multiple Budget Constraints



### Supply

Supply Curve = outcome of profit maximization

- Production Function $q = \sqrt{K * L}$â€‹
- Profit maximization at short term: $p = MC$

### Equilibrium

Social Surplus = net gains from trade in society

- Consumer Surplus = $\Delta$ Utility and Price
- Producer Surplus = $\Delta$ Production Cost and Price





Theorems of Welfare Economics

> **Theorem 1**: competetive Equilibrium (where supply = demand) maximizes social efficiency

> **Theorem 2:** society can attain efficient outcome by *suitably* redistributing resources among individuals + free trade

only under specific conditions!
