  abstract = {The notion that state capitalism (an economic system ``in which the state functions as the leading economic actor and uses markets primarily for political gain'') is a new form of capitalism emerging in the global arena has been recently advanced by several authors. This paper explores the problem of the nature of this system in the light of these claims to novelty. What are its main features as described by these authors? Is state capitalism distinctive from other forms of capitalism or other types of economic systems? Are we really witnessing the emergence of a new type of economic system? To address such questions the paper starts by trying to place the model of state capitalism within the traditional comparative economic systems framework. The inconclusive result leads to a different approach in which the concept of rent-seeking society is used to underlie the structural similarities between mercantilism, real life socialism and state capitalism. The article argues that the conjecture that what has been labeled ``state capitalism'' is yet another form of rent-seeking system is both robust and worth further investigating.},

  abstract = {F. A. Hayek's The Road to Serfdom continues to provoke intense scholarly debate focused on the validity of Hayek's central claim that a mixed economy is inherently unstable and economic intervention will inexorably lead to totalitarianism if pursued for a sustained period. This article presents empirical evidence which shows conclusively that it is the mixed economy that has proved remarkably stable, whereas laissez-faire and totalitarian regimes have proved inherently unstable. It is argued that this empirical outcome can be explained by the dynamics of rent seeking and Hayek's failure to anticipate that the state could control more than half of national income without requiring a totalitarian apparatus to control and direct production and consumption. The implications of the failure of Hayek's argument for our conceptualisation of freedom and power in the context of the modern democratic state and our understanding of the relationship between economic and political freedom are considered.},

Second, growth rates are benchmarked to multiple years of cross-country price data so they are less sensitive to new benchmark data. Third, data on capital stocks and productivity are (re)introduced.

Its origins lie in power struggles within the political elite, in efforts by members of that elite to enrich themselves and in a profound distrust on the part of that elite of any sources of power that they do not themselves control. One result is that business confidence has been dented, the growth of oil output has slowed, and future GDP growth depends more heavily than before on further growth in oil prices.},

Originally published in 1944, it was seen as heretical for its passionate warning against the dangers of state control over the means of production. For Hayek, the collectivist idea of empowering government with increasing economic control would lead not to a utopia but to the horrors of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. This new edition includes a foreword by series editor and leading Hayek scholar Bruce Caldwell explaining the book's origins and publishing history and assessing common misinterpretations of Hayek's thought. Caldwell has also standardized and corrected Hayek's references and added helpful new explanatory notes. Supplemented with an appendix of related materials and forewords to earlier editions by the likes of Milton Friedman, and Hayek himself, this new edition of The Road to Serfdom will be the definitive version of Friedrich Hayek's enduring masterwork.},

This pattern is most pronounced for large state-owned firms. State-owned firms are responsive to the Russian foreign policy agenda, while privately-owned firms appear to be more autonomous. The evidence suggests that Russia deploys state-owned firms to extend its influence and exerts influence to make their investments profitable.},

Inspired by theories on belonging, media and visibility, it reconstructs a dominant narrative representing non-heterosexuals as threatening the future survival of the nation, as imposing the sex-radical norms of a minority onto the majority, or as connected to an imperialistic West which aims to destroy Russia. This story, it is argued, functions as a hegemonic grammar regulating how non-heterosexuality is seen and heard in the public sphere. However, it is argued that sometimes the linearity and cohesiveness of the narrative breaks down, when things appear that do not fit this model of interpretation. The analysis illustrates how contestations of belonging in contemporary media are increasingly structured according to the logic of visibility: dominant actors attempt to regulate what can be seen and heard in the public sphere whereas oppositional actors attempt to establish their own visibility in the mediated space of appearance, putting forward alternative constructions of the nation and who belongs to it.},

The fascinating story of purged and surviving old oligarchs is researched in detail as are the careers, profiles and business practices of the new state-oligarchs, and the re-emerging role of the central state. The new state-oligarchic interplay is made visible in Russia's decisive energy export policy. The fate of foreign investors is reviewed in Bill Bowder's Heritage Fund as a suitably instructive case study.},

  abstract = {Low productivity and the competitiveness of Russian firms have been among Russia's primary economic challenges over the past decade. The Government of Russia (GoR) has made boosting productivity a policy priority and since 2012 has rolled out several visible policy initiatives to strengthen employment practices in firms to raise their productivity and positive spillovers, including the 2012 Plan for Raising the Productivity of Companies, the 2018-2024 National Project on Labor Productivity, and 2018-2019 National Plan for Competition Development. The objective of this report is to contribute to this productivity agenda by analyzing the employment practices of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), their implications for labor supply and internal firm capabilities, and the influence of state policy. SOEs contribute a significant share of output and employment in Russia's economy and academic recent research shows that they have lower productivity than private sector firms. The implications of SOE employment practices\textemdash compensation and management\textemdash on overall productivity however, has not been investigated, a gap that this report aims to fill by analyzing the following questions: What are SOE employment practices and how do they compare to international and private sector benchmarks? How do SOE employment practices, particularly compensation, affect allocation of labor across firms? How do SOE compensation and management practices shape their internal capabilities? How does government financial and non-financial support to SOEs influence these employment practices? Taking the level and form of government participation in the economy as a given, the report focuses primarily on the sector's current practices, and how government policies towards the sector can be improved to boost SOE performance and positive spillovers. We explore these questions using five Russian microlevel datasets, including worker and firm surveys and a large firm register. The report utilizes a taxonomy of SOEs that includes state SOEs which have 100 percent government ownership, and mixed SOEs which have some share of state ownership that is less than 100 percent. The report finds that Russian SOEs pay an overall compensation premium and that this premium contributes to labor shortages in the private sector. While overall the SOE sector has a small wage penalty, wage differentials with the private sector vary by type and size of the SOEs. Mixed SOEs pay a small wage premium over the private sector while state SOEs have a small wage penalty. Both types of SOEs pay a wage premium in competitive settings. SOEs have an overall compensation premium as they provide more generous benefits like paid vacations, maternity leave, and training than private sector firms.},
