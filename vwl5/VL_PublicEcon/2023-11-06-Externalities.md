# 06.11.2023 Externalities

> **Externalities:** situation, where ones party action affects others, but is not compensated

Example: Pollution, Education

Externalities = market failure => government intervention



## Externality Theory

Types:

- positive / negative (Pollution / Education)
- from production / from consumption (Pollution / Smoking)



Example: Steel Company

- Production of steel and sludge 
- 1 unit of sludge for every unit of steel
- sludge directed into stream, kills fish from fishers

Externalities: SMC $\neq$ PMC

> **Private Marginal Cost (PMC):** direct cost to produce one good

> **Social Marginal Cost (SMC):** PMC + costs imposed on others

Example: ![img](../images/2023-11-06_15-26-06.jpg)

Types of Externalities:

- negative production: SMC > PMC
- negative consumption: SMB < PMB (Private Marginal Benefit)
- ...



Solution: **internalize Externalities**

- private negotiation
- government solutions



## Private Sector

> **Coase Theorem:** well defined property rights + negotiations => socially optimal market quantity

Example: 

- Fishers own the property rights
- negotiate compensation with steel plant

**Important:** Efficient solution *does not depend* who owns the property rights!

**Problems**: (especially with many people)

- Assignment Problem
    - who causes the damage?
    - how large is the damage?
- Holdout Problem
    - shared ownership of rights = veto options
    - may demand enormous payments
- Free Rider Problem
- Transaction Costs / Negotiationg Problems



**=> Coase only works with specific problems!**



## Public Interventions

Instruments:

- Taxation / Subsidies
    - internalize externality
    - correct tax = *Pigou Tax*
- Regulation
