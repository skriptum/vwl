Publication: GAIA - Ecological Perspectives for Science and Society
Title: Rethinking gender: feminist perspectives on Sustainable Development Goals in the light of (re)productivity
```



- What are the links between power structures in the categories *gender* and *nature*

    - ecologicla crisis + social crisis (crisis of reproductive work) = same origin

    - = economic rationality

    - undervaluation of both womens care work and natures work

    - nature = reproduction too

    - women = especially affected by nature destruction

pros and cons of Sustainable Development from a feminist view

- Pro:

    - acknowledged that social situation and nute situation = two sides of same coin
    - SDG5: women need education for growth = good acknowledgement

- Cons:

    - feminising environmental responsability
    - clarifiction of conflicting goals missing

## FPE Case Study in Ukraine

```
Title: Pipes, profits and peace: toward a feminist political economy of gas during war
Author: Elliot Dolan-Evans
Publication: Review of International Political Economy
```



mainstream International Political Economy

- only focuses on elites
- “at arms length” of real people
- methodological liberalism
    - necessity of liberal states and markets for peace
- => International Financial Institutions are good

feminist IPE:

- critical view on power
- conceptual framework of social reproduction

------

> **IFI:** International Financial Institutions, esp. IMF /& WB

- legitimized as partners in peacebuilding
- economic stabilizatin and rebuilding

active role

- deregulation
- citizens => entrepreneurs
- neoliberal insitutionalism

Impacts:

- esp. marginalized groups
- gendered impacts

------

Case Study: Ukraine and Gas Infrastructire

Research:

- Role of IFIs in Conflict
- Focus on Energy as vital part of everyday life

Focus:

- Restructruing of Ukr. Gas Infrastrucuture due to IFI demands

------

### Framework

feminist Global Political Economy (GPE):

- materialist understanding
- of social relations of inequality
- that contributes gendered understanding

Views:

- materialistic
- social world = relations
- subject  embeddedness in surroundings
- = micro focus

=> analyze how everyday relations shape especcialy women

Reproduction:

- network of social processes
- reproduce society / workforce

e.g ukrainian women caring for their injured soldier husbands



------

### Case Study

Ukraine War

- since 2014
- 3500 Civilians dead
- displacement of 1.5 Million

Method:

- semi sctructured interviews
- all in 2018

------

### History

Before:

- Soviet Union heavy state sibsidized
- minimal cost of energy to consumers

IFIs view:

- neoliberal insitutionalist paradigm
- energy subsidies = distortion of markets
- inefficient

distributional view:

- larger households = consume more gas = more profit from subsidy
    - but empirically not true
    - poorer households = lewss well insulated / colder regions …
- poorer groups = relative more harm from price increase
    - and not price elastic!

Policy:

- Great Financial Crisis = need for capital
- IMF imposed price hikes on Ukr. Government
    - for better state finances
    - 30% hikes in one year
    - Yanukovich not follow
- after Euromaidan
    - more hikes (60%)
    - but difficult situation with War in Donbas

=> 425% price increase in 2015

- highest gas costs in Europe
- as proportion of income
- oligarchic privatization of infrastructure

------

### (Gendered) Impacts

#### Direct Impacts

- 9,5 times price increase
- 42% of pop. material deprivation
- mainly due to energy prices
- Solution: Housing Subsidy for Poors
    - but not accesible to poor / displaced persons
    - inadequate to cover costs
    - poor  implementation
    - transfered direct to gas companies
        - for “competition”



#### Indirect Impacts

- especially rural households
    - higher heating costs
    - war-torn regions
    - depressed regions
- biomass used as alternative
    - forest wood (45% of families)
    - health effects
- women bear impact
    - search for wood
    - more time around stove (breathe particles)
    - violence when searching (mines etc.)



- water more scarce
    - 50% switcch to triucked water (instead of piped)
    - lower water quality
    - poor sanitation

=> declinig heath, esp. women



#### Broader Patterns

privatization and women

- care work more privatized
- targeted for mass layofss
- 2/3 of new unemplyoed = women

Care Work

- more for women (49H vs 22H per week)
- more children at home (less social service)
- more injured (war)



Circuit of Violence

- more privatization = higher costs & less service
- care more for children = difficult to find wage work
- less money = less heating at home
- family / children get more sick = even more staying at home



Violence:

- higher stress due to higher expenses
