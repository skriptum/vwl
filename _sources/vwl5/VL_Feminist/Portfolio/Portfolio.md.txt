## Introduction

Nobel Prize Cliffhanger

Presentation of the different chapters

## Motivation

- neoclassical education
- no thinking about women
    - Only in one lecture shortly with a framework of gary Becker
    - Women as rational choice models devoid of discrimation and history
- wanted to learn more about historical perspectives
- develop a feeling fore the feminist school of thought in economics
- feelig of injustice aorung gender in society
    - not diectly personally affected
    - but trough gender norms still

## Learning Process

- Chapter in Book very fundamental
    - not deep in data / statistics
- from my bachelor more accommodated to data-heavy and sometimes boring slides full of graphs
- not in this lecture, which was more theoretical and narrative-based
    - difficult for me to adapt, feeling that the chapters may be lacking
    - wanted to know more about the data
- maybe hanging together with my disdain for qualitative research
    - only teached quantitative in uni
    - therefore personally no knowledge in qualitative
    - see it as more primitive way of research (dumb)
- course opened my eyes to be more open toward it



- on site weekends = very informative
    - sharing of personal expereinces by others in the group
    - good choice of texts, introduction into completely different topics
    - got to know more about this complex school of thought
    - good discussions 



Consequences

- incorporate class / gender more into economic analyisis
- new perspective especially for intersectionality
    - Was not as present before
- better prepared for discussions with neoclassical economists
- find taste for qualitative research
    - not just quantiative view i had before
    - especially Pipes, Profits Peace Text





## Nobel Prize and Feminist Economics

Nobel Prize of Sveriges Riksbank economics

- biggest achievement in Economics 
- historically only third women to receive (Goldin, Duflo, Ostrom)
- mostly to neoclassical / mainstream economics, altough some opening in recent years
    - behaviroal economics 
    - game theory
    - => nobel prize = incorporation into mainstream
- how this years nobel prize reflects advancements of Feminist Economics into the Mainstream?



about goldin

- educated at University of Chicago = heart of neoliberalism
- under Gary Becker (marginal choice analysis of women)
    - family as little factory
    - rational choice of number of work / kids
- infleunced heavily by 1970s womens movement
- 1972 phD
- first professor with tenure economics harvard
- pioneer? even though very classical education





Goldins Take on

- intra-Household
    - analysis of Different earnings men and women
    - deviation of Gary Beckers Way
    - trajectories of pay after birth for father / mother
    - regular on Gender Pay Gap News Channels
        - But: no deviations from standard household
        - only white middle class women focused
        - no single parents etc...
        - rising share of non-common households therefore not included

- Labor-Market Inequality & Wage Compression
    - Analysis for lower Inequality in 1950s etc.
    - demand for lower skilled workers
    - and war price controls




- historical perspective
    - disputed common perspective that progress => more women in labor
    - showed with new historical data that before industrialization = women more equal work
    - Goldins U

- Research Ways (@Small)
    - shift to instituational economics
    - cites feminist economists
    - more textual / narrative than most neoclassical 
    - historical analysis, not just mathematics

- Feminist Movements
    - newest paper (why women won)
    - describing fights of womens movement for rights
    - explains legal hurdles / societal obstacles overcome
    - also describes antifeminist movements (past + today)






and her not exisitng takes on (@Kesar)

- global south (not advanced economics)
- informal jobs more common there
- Class / Caste perspective



=> gradual movement into more heterodox direction

- started as neoclassical economist
- moved into new directiosn (institutionalist / feminist)
- new topics and research methods
- not yet fully FPE, but starting to cite them
- openend possibilities for more women in economics
    - Graduate Program onyl for women
- Nobel Prize = acknowledgement of this research in mainstream
    - more gaps open for more FPE in mainstream
    - maybe one day it will also be teached in mainstream economics
- i wouldnt need to take extra classes like this, but would be included in my curriculum
