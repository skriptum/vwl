## 1) Definitions

- Government Bonds: future payment obligation issued by government for funds

- Principal: amount to be payed at end
- Coupon: Interest

Interest Rate (of zero-coupon bond): 

$$
i = \frac{ Principal }{price_{market}}-1
$$

## 2) Fiscal Budget

$$
T+\Delta B = G+ iB 
$$

leads to: equilibirum debt ratio

$$
b^* = \frac{ g-t }{y-r}
$$

This determines the position and equilbrium here:

## 3) Sovereign Default

Interest:

$$
i = \frac{ i_0+w }{1-w}
$$
Why is it equilibrium and true?

- safe bond: $price_{safe}=\frac{ payoff_{safe} }{1+i_0}$
    - so safe : $1+i_0 = \frac{ payoff}{price}$
- if return on bond is too high:
    - if $i > \frac{ i_0+w }{1-w}$ means
    - expected return of risky investment > expected return of safe investment
- investors would react
