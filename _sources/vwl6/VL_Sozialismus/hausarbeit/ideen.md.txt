Contrafakt: synthetic yugoslavia

## Introduction

argue that economics is reason for downfall of yugoslavia

- external reasons for it
- no amoubnt of internal shuffle could have saved it



## Existing Explanations

Existing Explanations [@jovicDisintegrationYugoslaviaCritical2001]

1. the "ancient hatred" argument
2. the "nationalism" argument
3. the cultural argument
4. the economic argument
5. the international politics argument
6. the "role of personality" argument
7. the "fall of empires" argument

all arguments have an explanation, my argument ranges between economic and international politics => external factors



focusing on economic

[@yarashevichEconomicReasonsBreakup2013a] : economic reasons

- external debt
- self management
- trade imbalances
- labor market



[@zizmondCollapseYugoslavEconomy1992] 

- description of yugoslav economy
- while yugoslavia still existed (1992), but already in disappearance



most of economic literature = inflation, eg **XX**



[@kukicOriginsRegionalDivergence2020]

- regional divergence
- not as reason for breakup







## Economic System of Yugoslavia

- Factor Inputs
- Regional Divergence

History:

- 1960s = success
- 1980s = stagnation
- Government Program of Markovik in 1990: final transformation to market economy
- final breakdown shortly afterwards

not focus on war and 1991 + later



## Oil Shock

*start if stagflation in yugoslavia: oil shock of 1979*

- 1973: covered relatively easily
    - price shock was not as extreme
    - forreign borrowing to keep up imports
    - relationships with non-aliged countries
- 1979: more deeper shock, oil prices rise extremely

- energy dependence
    - Graph: energy as % of Imports
- payment of oil imports = very difficult
    - create BOP crisis, see later

quote: 

> for a country like Yugoslavia, which was greatly dependent on imported fuel paid for in hard currency, the oil price crisis alone could have resulted in financial ruin

## Aftermath

Oil Shock = deep scars in capitalist core and periphery



### inflation

- Graph: Inflation
- imported into yugoslavia 
- FED reaction: interest rate rise (Volcker shock 1981)
- heavy impact on developing countries

### staglfation in west

- less demand for yugoslav goods (especially machinery)
- one of the main export products
- impossibility to export = no hard currencies
- less remittances



### BOP and Debt

=> balance of payments crisis

- less exports than imports 
- not really possibility to adapt in this situation
- difference covered by external debt (as many developing countries)
- credit was cheap in the 1970s
    - western capital searching for opportunity
    - low interest rates

=> debt crisis

- 1982: no more possible on market, western banks stop lending

## IMF

critical literature [@chossudovskyGlobalisationPovertyImpacts1998]

IMF = saviour?

- multiple programmes from 1981 onwards
- similar to other capitalist perphyery states
- 1981: demand shock and stop-go politics = austerity
    - trimming of federal budget
    - stagnating of output growth
    - negative rates investment growth
    - rising unemployment
    - XX compare to literature on IMF programmes
- had the desired effect = positive current account balane
    - but at what cost?
- Graph: Federal Budget or 



The End of yugoslav socialism: Markovic Reforms [@uvalicRiseFallMarket2019]

Property Changes

- protection for foreign investors
- no limits on private property
- sell off of worker owned 

Shock Doctrine 1989

- pegging of value to DMark
- price liberalization
- wage freezing

"first victim of washington consensus?"




## Conclusion

Breakdown: economic reasons => nationalism etc

- unique position = perfect storm to break the growth engine
- oil shock = also massively hit other countries
    - latin america, military coups etc
    - but the default of the capitalist society (IMF) always was stronger
    - Yugoslavia
