# 28.04.2023 Banks II

## Rates

banks set lending rate $r > r^p$ policy rate and based on:

- Risk of default
- risk tolerance 
- amount of bank equity
- degree of competition in banking sector



the higher $r \uparrow \implies L^S \downarrow$ Liquidity Supply lower

## Setting the Rate / Liquidity

based on the interest rate

Formula for Rate
$$
r = (1+ \mu^B) \ r^P ,\text{ with mark-up} = \mu^B
$$


Profit of a commercial Bank:
$$
V_B = 
\frac{rL^S - r^p (L^S-D-e)}{e}
-\frac{var(v)}{2 \tau}* 
\frac{L^S}{e}^2
$$

- r = lending rate
- $r^p$ = policy rate
- $L^S$ = credit supply
- $D$ = customer deposits
- $e$ = equity
- $\tau$ = risk tolerance
- $v$ = uncertain part of returns on loands
- $var(v)$ = riskiness of v

Terms explained:

- $rL^S$ = interest return on Loans
- $rL^S - r^p (L^S-D-e)$ = financing costs for credit not backed
- $(\frac{L^S}{e})^2$ = Bank Leverage
- $var(v) * \frac{L^S}{e}^2$ = total risk of bank



Refinancing Options of Banks:

- Interbanking Market
- loans from CB
- new deposits



**Derivation**

What is the optimal credit supply?
$$
\frac{\delta V_B}{\delta L^S} =
\frac{r-r^p}{e}  -\frac{var(v)L^S}{\tau e^2} = 0
$$
rewrite to determine the mark-up
$$
r - r^p = \frac{var(v)L^S}{\tau e} \\ 
\implies L^S = \frac{\tau e}{var (v)} * (r-r^p)
$$
logic: when to supply more?

- higher risk tolerance $\tau$
- higher equity $e$
- larger proft margin (markup) = higher incentive to supply 
- higher risk = lower supply

## Demand Liquidity

credit demand of private sector
$$
I = L^D = \bar{I} - a * r
$$
- I = autonomous / independent demand
- a = interest rate elasticity of investment demand 
    - how flexible are firms to "switch banks"

## Equilibrium

$$
\overbrace{\frac{\tau e}{var (v)} * (r-r^p)}^{Supply} =
\overbrace{\bar{I}-a*r}^{Demand}
$$
solve for r
$$
r [\frac{\tau e}{var (v)}+a] = \frac{r^p \tau e}{var(v)}+ \bar{I} \\
$$
leads to:
$$
r = \frac
{\frac{r^p \tau e}{var(v)}+ \bar{I}}
{\frac{\tau e}{var (v)}+a} 
= 
\frac{r^p + \frac{\bar{I}* var(v)}{\tau e}}
{1+ \frac{a * var(v)}{\tau e}}
$$
Conclusions: interest **rate increases**:

1. with higher autonomous demand $\bar{I}$ : 
    - more competition for loans (constant)
2. with higher policy rate $r^p$
    - because of passtrough
3. lower interest rate elasticity a
    - lower a = firms demand less flexible = less punishable = easier to hike markup
4. riskiness of loans
5. lower risk tolerance / lower equity

claims 3+4+5 further proofs needed



## Information asymmetry

- Moral Hazard (ex post)
- adverse selection (ex ante)
    - low risks dont want average rate, but high risks do
    - banks react and limit credit

=> banks require equity as incentive





**=> in exam: do math and get points**

obwohl diese Mathematik extrem kompliziert ist...
