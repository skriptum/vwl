## Introduction

Nobel Prize Cliffhanger

Presentation of the different chapters

## Motivation

- me = only neoclassical education
- no thinking about women
    - Only in one lecture shortly with a framework of gary Becker
    - Women as rational choice models devoid of discrimation and history
- wanted to learn more about historical perspectives
- develop a feeling fore the feminist school of thought in economics
- feelig of injustice aorung gender in society
    - not diectly personally affected
    - but trough gender norms still

## Learning Journey

Course

- fulfilled my hopes of learning more about gender injustices
- and also especially the eurocentrism of my current knowledge
    - white privileges
    - gender norms in different societies
- other concepts championed by Feminist Economists = informative
    - esp. Buen Vivir, completely different from western conceptions of utopia (e.g socialism)
    - incorporation of women into political alternatives
    - Hopeful 

- Challenging for me: Chapter in Book very basic
    - not deep in data / statistics
- from my bachelor more accommodated to data-heavy and sometimes boring slides full of graphs
- not in this lecture, which was more theoretical and narrative-based
    - difficult for me to adapt, feeling that the chapters may be lacking
    - wanted to know more about the data
- reflection process: maybe hanging together with my disdain for qualitative research
    - only teached quantitative in uni
    - therefore personally no knowledge in qualitative
    - see it as more primitive way of research (dumb)
- course opened my eyes to be more open toward it
    - especially Pipes, Profits Peace Text


another challenge = openness of the final paper

- never written a paper as a course exam in my study
- mostly used to Multiple Choice Exams
- degree of freedom in chosing topic = quite difficult



- on site weekends = very informative
    - sharing of personal expereinces by others in the group
    - good choice of texts, introduction into completely different topics
    - got to know more about this complex school of thought
    - good discussions 



Learnings of the course for future

- incorporate class / gender more into economic analyisis
- new perspective especially for intersectionality
    - Was not as present before
- better prepared for discussions with neoclassical economists
- find taste for qualitative research
    - not just quantiative view i had before



new:

role of men in discussion was shown

- me included, always talked more
- critical reflection of my own actions
- how to create spaces that are more open to participatio from women

- especially in our local group of Pluralist Economics



## Nobel Prize and Feminist Economics

Intro:

- this chapter = analyze Claudia goldins work from feminist economics perspective
- is claudia goldin feminist economist?
- nobel prize = sign of feminist economics in mainstream?



### Nobel Prize of Sveriges Riksbank economics

- biggest achievement in Economics 
- historically only third women to receive (Goldin, Duflo, Ostrom)
- mostly to neoclassical / mainstream economics, altough some opening in recent years
    - behaviroal economics 
    - game theory
    - => nobel prize = incorporation into mainstream



### about goldin

- educated at University of Chicago = heart of neoliberalism
- under Gary Becker (marginal choice analysis of women)
    - family as little factory
    - rational choice of number of work / kids
- infleunced heavily by 1970s womens movement
- 1972 phD
- first professor with tenure economics harvard
- pioneer? even though very classical education



Goldins Take on

### Household (Chapter 6)

Neoclassical

- Household = Black Box
- income pooling
- equal benefit of household income
- exmeplified Gary Becker: household as firm, profit maximizing

Goldin

- analysis of Different earnings men and women
- deviation of Gary Beckers Way
- trajectories of pay after birth for father / mother 
    - parenthood effect
    - "price of being female"
- Household not understood as bacl box, but as shaped by societal / economic forces

But in most of her work

- no deviations from standard household
- apparingly white middle class women focused
- no single parents etc...
- rising share of non-common households therefore not included

---

### Labor-Market Inequality (Chapter 6)

Neoclassic Classical

- labour amrket = demand & supply
- shaped by human capital
    - = human capital theory Mincer
- explains gendered pay effects, because women less human capital
- growth = more demand = more women in labor force

FPE:

- barriers to human capital accumulation (e.g cost of education)
- accumulation of privilege by men
- reinforcemnt of stereotypes in household
- housework in general not being taken into account



Goldin

- historical analyis of reasons women were not working
    - regulations against women taking jobs
    - societal norms

- but model of women = human capital rational model
- changing nature of society = more rational to invest in education etc.
- middle way



### Feminist Movements

FPE: 

- developed out of feminist movement / collective action
- "Research can be a central component in praxis, providing a guide to, and a reflection on action."
- analyze potential for movements and describe womens movements

Goldin similar

- does not stop at analyzing abstract technological changes
- analyze their impacts on society
    - i.e pill, not the theoretical possibilities of cheap birth control
    - but research the implementation of legal right to the pill had
    - more than just innovation, but legal implementation
- describing fights of womens movement for rights
- explains legal hurdles / societal obstacles overcome
- also describes antifeminist movements (past + today)



### Gloabl South: and her not exisitng takes

- hypothesis of Goldins U: 
- historical trajectory of women's emplyoment over countries development
- applicable to all countries

But: Kesar describes not hold everytime

- global south (not advanced economics)
- informal jobs more common there
- Class / Caste perspective



### Research Ways change (@Small)

- shift to instituational economics
- cites feminist economists lately
- more textual / narrative than most neoclassical 
- historical analysis, not just mathematics



### Summary

=> Claudia Goldin gradual movement into more heterodox direction

- started as neoclassical economist
- moved into new directiosn (institutionalist / feminist)
- new topics and research methods
- not yet fully FPE, but starting to cite them



- openend possibilities for more women in economics
    - Graduate Program onyl for women
- Nobel Prize = acknowledgement of this research in mainstream
    - more gaps open for more FPE in mainstream
    - maybe one day it will also be teached in mainstream economics
- i wouldnt need to take extra classes like this, but would be included in my curriculum



Conclusion

- spaces for connecting schools of thought learned
- new research uncovered in process





- Critical self evaluation
- Privileges in our economy
- Distribution of care
- notnjust academic, also personal
