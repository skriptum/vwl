[Chapter 10: Banks, Money and Credit Market](https://www.core-econ.org/the-economy/book/text/10.html)

Money = medium of exchange for trade (requires trust)

## Intertemporal Optimization

Borrowing brings consumtpion to Future

- r = interest rate
- tradeoff = 1+r
- Repayment = principal + interest rate
- $91 (1+r) = 100$ , with r=10%

### Decisions

based on preferences of the consumer

- individuals want to smooth consumption
- overly high consumption in one period = costly

**Impatience**: Preference for present consumption

- measured by **discount rate** 
- affected by **desire to smooth** consumption



### Equilibrium

at Point where
$$
MRS = MRT \implies 1+p = 1+r
$$
with different endowments

- Julia = 100 in future (wants to borrow)
- Marco = 100 now (wants to save)

## Balance

- Assets = what person owns

- Liabilities = what person owes

- Net Worth = Assets - Liabilites
    - not impacted by borrowing etc.!

## Banking System

Definition

> **Bank:** a firm that makes profits by lending and borrowing

> **Central Bank:** bank owned by government with money creation monopoly

Structure of the System

![img](../images/2023-04-27_15-44-04.jpg)



- **policy interest rate** = set by CB
- **bank lending rate** = banks rate on consumer loans

banks set lending rate $r > r^p$ policy rate and based on:

- Risk of default
- risk tolerance 
- amount of bank equity
- degree of competition in banking sector



the higher $r \uparrow \implies L^S \downarrow$ Liquidity Supply lower

### Setting the Rate / Liquidity

based on the interest rate

Formula for Rate
$$
r = (1+ \mu^B) \ r^P ,\text{ with mark-up} = \mu^B
$$


Profit of a commercial Bank:
$$
V_B = 
\frac{rL^S - r^p (L^S-D-e)}{e}
-\frac{var(v)}{2 \tau}* 
\frac{L^S}{e}^2
$$

- r = lending rate
- $r^p$ = policy rate
- $L^S$ = credit supply
- $D$ = customer deposits
- $e$ = equity
- $\tau$ = risk tolerance
- $v$ = uncertain part of returns on loands
- $var(v)$ = riskiness of v

Terms explained:

- $rL^S$ = interest return on Loans
- $rL^S - r^p (L^S-D-e)$ = financing costs for credit not backed
- $(\frac{L^S}{e})^2$ = Bank Leverage
- $var(v) * \frac{L^S}{e}^2$ = total risk of bank



Refinancing Options of Banks:

- Interbanking Market
- loans from CB
- new deposits



**Derivation**

What is the optimal credit supply?
$$
\frac{\delta V_B}{\delta L^S} =
\frac{r-r^p}{e}  -\frac{var(v)L^S}{\tau e^2} = 0
$$
rewrite to determine the mark-up
$$
r - r^p = \frac{var(v)L^S}{\tau e} \\ 
\implies L^S = \frac{\tau e}{var (v)} * (r-r^p)
$$
logic: when to supply more?

- higher risk tolerance $\tau$
- higher equity $e$
- larger proft margin (markup) = higher incentive to supply 
- higher risk = lower supply

### Demand Liquidity

credit demand of private sector
$$
I = L^D = \bar{I} - a * r
$$
Equilibrium: 
$$
\overbrace{\frac{\tau e}{var (v)} * (r-r^p)}^{Supply} =
\overbrace{\bar{I}-a*r}^{Demand}
$$
solve for r
$$
r [\frac{\tau e}{var (v)}+a] = \frac{r^p \tau e}{var(v)}+ \bar{I} \\
$$
leads to:
$$
r = \frac
{\frac{r^p \tau e}{var(v)}+ \bar{I}}
{\frac{\tau e}{var (v)}+a} = 
\frac{r^p + \frac{\bar{I}* var(v)}{\tau e}}
{1+ \frac{a * var(v)}{\tau e}}
$$
Conclusions: interest rate increases:

- with higher autonomous demand I : more competition for loans
- with higher policy rate $r^p$
