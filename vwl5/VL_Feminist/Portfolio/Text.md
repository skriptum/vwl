# Introduction {.unnumbered}

In the ever-evolving landscape of economic thought and research, the 2023 Nobel Prize in Economics marked a significant milestone, casting a luminous spotlight on the intersectionality of gender and economic dynamics. Awarded to Claudia Goldin, a distinguished economist, the recognition emphasizes the growing importance of women's perspectives in shaping the economic discipline. 

As I navigate the landscape of Feminist Political Economy, this milestone fuels my curiosity, prompting a deeper exploration into the intersection of gender and economic dynamics. Throughout this portfolio, I aim to articulate [my motivations](#motivation) for undertaking this course, document my [learning process](#learning), and critically examine [Goldin's scientific achievements](#essay), whose work encapsulates the advancing landscape of economic research with a focus on women's issues.

# Motivation {#motivation}

My academic journey has been shaped by a predominantly neoclassical education, where discussions on women within economic frameworks were noticeably absent. A solitary lecture, rooted in Gary Becker's framework, briefly touched upon women as rational choice models, divorced from the complexities of discrimination and historical context. This limited perspective sparked my curiosity, leading me to question the adequacy of such a gender-neutral approach. 

Motivated by a desire for a more comprehensive understanding, i took part in this course on "Feminist Political Economy". The absence of context about economic phenomena in my previous studies left me with a curiosity about how economic structures intertwine with historical contexts, particularly in the context of gender dynamics. Concurrently, I aimed to develop a practical understanding of the feminist school of thought in economics, perceiving it as a valuable alternative framework offering insights into women's experiences within economic systems. 

While I haven't personally faced gender injustice, I've noticed the unfairness around gender norms in society. Even though it hasn't directly impacted me, I can see how these norms play a role in creating inequalities. Joining this course is my way of trying to understand the reasons behind these issues and how they're built into our systems. I wanted to learn more about the structural aspects that contribute to gender injustices, hoping to gain a clearer picture of these complex dynamics.



# Learning Journey {#learning}

The "Feminist Political Economy" course has been a valuable learning experience, meeting my expectations in a practical sense. It has allowed me to explore gender injustices more thoroughly, shedding light on the structural factors contributing to gender disparities. Additionally, the course has effectively addressed the Eurocentrism in my previous knowledge, offering insights into white privileges [@mcintoshWhitePrivilegeUnpacking2019] and diverse gender norms across societies. This analytical approach has not only expanded my understanding of global gender dynamics but has also prompted thoughtful reflection on my own position within these systems.

Exploring concepts championed by Feminist Economists in the course has been eye-opening. The idea of "Buen Vivir" stands out, offering a stark contrast to Western utopian ideals like socialism [@lanzaBuenVivirIntroduction2012]. Rooted in indigenous South American philosophy, Buen Vivir emphasizes community well-being and environmental sustainability. Additionally, delving into the integration of women into political projects like the "Green New Deal" [@bauhardtEcofeministPoliticalEconomy2022], that focus too much on technological solutions to societal problems have opened my eyes for these other perspectives, which are commonly missing in courses on Economic Policy . These insights have not only broadened my theoretical framework but also instilled hope for alternative economic and political models centered around inclusivity and sustainability.

The chapters in the book [@cantillonFeministPoliticalEconomy2023] presented a notable departure from my familiar data-heavy approach during my bachelor's studies, where I often encountered slides filled with graphs and statistics, sometimes feeling tedious but offering a concrete understanding. In contrast, the lecture for this chapter took a more theoretical and narrative route. This shift posed a challenge for me in adapting, as I perceived a lack of in-depth empirical data in the chapters, leaving me eager to explore data-driven perspectives that align more with my accustomed style.

The reflective process prompted by the course has unveiled a connection between my initial discomfort with the material and a predisposition against qualitative research. Having been exclusively taught quantitative methods in university, my lack of personal knowledge in qualitative approaches led me to view it as a somewhat primitive or less sophisticated form of research. However, the course has acted as a catalyst, opening my eyes to the value and nuanced insights that qualitative research can offer, especially the field research on the role of gas during war [@dolan-evansPipesProfitsPeace2023]. This shift in perspective marks a personal growth, encouraging me to be more open-minded and appreciative of diverse research methodologies.

Another challenge on this learning journey has been adapting to the open-ended nature of the final paper, a departure from my previous experience with multiple-choice exams. Having never tackled a paper as a course exam in my academic history, the degree of freedom in choosing a topic presented a novel and somewhat daunting task. This shift demanded a new set of skills in topic selection, research design, and effective communicationâ€”a transition I found to be both challenging and ultimately rewarding in fostering a more independent and critical approach to academic work

The on-site weekends were quite informative, thanks to the practical sharing of personal experiences by fellow participants. The choice of texts was thoughtful, introducing me to various topics within feminist political economy. Engaging discussions further enhanced my grasp of the subject, making the on-site sessions a valuable component of the learning process.

Building on these learnings, the next chapter delves into a scientific analysis of Claudia Goldin's achievements within mainstream and neoclassical economics. By scrutinizing her work, I aim to draw connections between feminist perspectives and mainstream economic thought, uncovering the potential for a more integrated and inclusive economic framework.



# Feminist Economics and the Mainstream {#essay}

In this chapter, I embark on an analytical exploration of Claudia Goldin's body of work, employing a feminist economics perspective as our guiding lens. A fundamental query underscores our examination: does Claudia Goldin align with the designation of a feminist economist? The context of the 2023 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences, bestowed upon Goldin, serves as a catalyst for our investigation, prompting us to scrutinize whether this esteemed recognition signifies the incorporation of feminist economics into the mainstream discourse. 

## The Nobel Prize

The Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences, awarded by Sveriges Riksbank, stands as the pinnacle of achievement in the field of economics. Claudia Goldin's recognition in 2023 as one of the laureates marked a historic moment, as she joined the ranks of only three women, including Esther Duflo and Elinor Ostrom, to receive this prestigious honor. 

Historically, the Nobel Prize has predominantly favored contributions aligned with neoclassical and mainstream economic theories. However, recent years have witnessed a notable opening to alternative perspectives, with behavioral economics and game theory gaining recognition [@nasarSometimesDismalNobel2001]. It reflects a broader acknowledgment of a more diverse range of economic theories and perspectives beyond the traditional neoclassical framework and symbolizes a "acceptance stamp" of these ideas and their incorporation into mainstream [boettkeImpactNobelPrize2012].

## Claudia Goldin's Background

Claudia Goldin, hailing from the University of Chicago, a hub of neoliberalism, received her education under the guidance of Gary Becker. His academic focus involved marginal choice analysis, where families were viewed as pragmatic units making rational decisions about work and family size [@beckerTreatiseFamilyEnlarged1991]. This is very far from the feminist economists view on family, which focuses more on societal norms and historical shifts.

Notably, her formative years coincided with the surge of the second women's movement, when she earned her PhD in 1972. She eventually became the first tenured female economics professor at Harvard and the third women at the head of the influential American Economic Association. Notwithstanding her education deeply rooted in neoclassical economics, Goldin carved out a pioneering career in her mostly male-dominated field [@walkerProfileHarvardEconomist2018].

## Summary

# Conclusion

The course has equipped me with valuable insights for the future. I now aim to incorporate class and gender considerations more prominently into economic analyses, recognizing the significance of these dimensions. The exposure to the concept of intersectionality, a perspective less emphasized in my prior education, has broadened my understanding.. Additionally, the course has better prepared me for discussions with neoclassical economists about gender topics, where before I sometimes failed to convincingly argue with them. Perhaps most notably, I have developed an appreciation for qualitative research, expanding beyond my previous quantitative orientation, which will enrich my approach to future research endeavors.
