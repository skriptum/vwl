Model:

$$
y = \underbrace{\bar{y}}_{trend GDP} + \underbrace{I(i)}_{investment} + \underbrace{d}_{demand\ shock}
$$

- I = "real/ physical" Investment as Function of Interest Rate (negative): 
    - $I = \phi_1-\phi_2i$: negative sloped line

- Function describes GDP as part of Investment and Trend


$$
\pi = \underbrace{\pi^e}_{expected} + \alpha \underbrace{(y-\bar{y})}_{output\ gap} + \underbrace{s}_{supply \ shock}
$$

- Inflation is influenced by price shocks (e.g. oil), output gap and expectations
- output gap is unfleunced by aggergate demand


$$
L = \beta (y- \tilde{y})^2+ \underbrace{(\pi - \pi^*)^2}_{inflation \ target}
$$

- Loss Function for central bank with two targets (inflation and GDP / employment)
- $\tilde{y}= k \bar{y}$ = estimate of trend with k=1 is perfect estimate



Questions:

a) price and wage setters are forward looking, incorporate exceptions into todays prices

b) explicti channel = Investment and interest rate, implicit = asset prices, exchange rate etc.

**c) Barro Gordon: optimal *i* = minimal of loss function**

$$
L = \beta (y- \tilde{y})^2+ (\pi - \pi^*)^2 \\
= \beta [\bar{y}(1-k)+ I(i)+d]^2
+ [\pi^e + a (I(i)+d)+s-\pi^*]^2 \\ \\

\frac{ dL }{di} = 2 \beta [\bar{y}(1-k)+I(i)+d] I'(i) 
+ 2 [\pi^e+\alpha * (I(i)+d)+s-\pi^e]\alpha I'(i) = 0 \\ \\

\implies i = \frac{ \phi_1 }{\phi_2}+...+...+ \frac{ 1 }{\phi}d+ ...
$$

**d) demand shock and interest rate**

- Assumptions: no supply shock, no expectations
- then interest rate only influenced by d

$$
i = \frac{ \phi_1 }{\phi_2}+ \frac{ 1 }{\phi}d
$$

- every demand shock should be counteracted by interest rate
- when central bank reacts accordingly, output gap = 0, $\Delta$ unemployment = 0

Umstellen von Equation 1: und *i* einsetzen

$$
y-\bar{y}= \phi_1-\phi_2i+d
$$



**e) supply shock**

$$
i = \frac{ \phi_1 }{\phi_2}+ \frac{ a }{\phi_2 (a^2+b)}s
$$

- supply shock such as oil shock
- but here central bank reaction produces negative output gap

$$
y-\bar{y}= \phi_1-\phi_2i  \\
=  \phi_1-\phi_2i \big(\frac{ \phi_1 }{\phi_2}+ \frac{ a }{\phi_2 (a^2+b)}s\big) \\
= - \frac{ a }{a^2+b}s < 0
$$

=> lowering interest rates in supply shock = instrument with side effects

**f) central bank willingness**

- if $\beta$ high, then central bank more focused on output gap than interest rate
- b = 0, only inflation relevant, every (supply) shock will be absorbed by CB with rising interest rates
- b = $\infty$ , only unemployment relevant, CB will not raise i in response to shocks

=> b > 0 , then CB not as aggressive

**g) 1970s**

- oil price shock, but not enough reaction from CB
- inflation was getting permanent, expectations cement
- CB reaction: get kore hawkish, lower b

**h) Taylor rule**

$$
i-\pi = \underbrace{r}_{\phi_1/ \phi_2} + \underbrace{a(y-y)}_{d}+ \underbrace{b(\pi-\pi)}_{s}
$$


**j) CB Miscalculates**

interest rate with no shocks and anchored inflation:

$$
i = \frac{ \phi_1 }{\phi_2}+ \frac{ b}{\phi_2 (a^2+b)}(1-k)\bar{y}
$$

misplaced guess: k < 1

output gap:

$$
y-\bar{y}= \phi_1-\phi_2 \overbrace{\big(\frac{ \phi_1 }{\phi_2}+ \frac{ b}{\phi_2 (a^2+b)}(1-k)\bar{y} \big)} \\
= \frac{ b }{a^2+b}(k-1)\bar{y} < 0
$$

- CB overrreaction, interest rate is too high
- output gap is negative, inflation below target

**k) presidents influence**

- short term: k>1, GDP above potential, inflation above target
- medium term: expected inflation rises, inflationn remains high
- long term: inflation higher than target level
