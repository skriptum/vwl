The authors of this volume pursue the answers to these questions by studying the politics, economics, social and cultural movements of that time in the multiethnic countries of Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union. It becomes clear that these two countries were themselves in the midst of a latent crisis resulting from the global developments around them and from their own internal conflicts. The symptoms of this crisis were well known in expert circles, but not registered fully by either the political leaders or the citizens at large.},

  abstract = {Most large firms are controlled by shareholders, who choose the board of directors and can replace the firms management. In rare instances, however, control over the firm rests with the workforce. Many explanations for the rarity of workers' control have been offered, but there have been few attempts to assess these hypotheses in a systematic way. This book draws upon economic theory, statistical evidence, and case studies to frame an explanation. The fundamental idea is that labor is inalienable, while capital can be freely transferred from one person to another. This implies that worker controlled firms typically face financing problems, encounter collective choice dilemmas, and have difficulty creating markets for control positions within the firm. Together these factors can account for much of what is known about the incidence, behavior, and design of worker- controlled firms. A policy proposal to encourage employee buyouts is developed in the concluding chapter. Gregory L. Dow is Professor and Chair of the Department of Economics at Simon Fraser University, British Columbia, Canada. He previously taught at the University of Alberta and Yale University, and has served as a visiting professor at the University of New South Wales, the Erasmus Institute for Philosophy and Economics, and the Swedish Collegium for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences.

Using panel data for 98 countries over the period 1970--2000, it analyzes whether IMF involvement influences economic growth in program countries. Consistent with the results of previous studies, it is shown that IMF programs reduce growth rates when their endogeneity is accounted for. There is also evidence that compliance with conditionality mitigates this negative effect, while the overall impact, however, remains negative. IMF loans have no robust statistically significant impact.},

  abstract = {According to conventional wisdom, a fiscal consolidation is likely to contract real aggregate demand. It has often been argued, however, that this conclusion is misleading as it neglects the role of expectations of future policy; if the fiscal consolidation is read by the private sector as a signal that the share of government spending in GDP is being permanently reduced, households will revise upward the estimate of their permanent income, and will raise current and planned consumption. Only the empirical evidence can sort out which of these two contending views about fiscal policy is more appropriate-i.e., how often the contractionary effect of a fiscal consolidation prevails on its expansionary expectational effect. This paper brings new evidence to bear on this issue drawing on the European exercise in fiscal rectitude of the 1980s, and focusing, in particular, on its two most extreme cases-Denmark and Ireland. We find that at least in the experience of these two countries the expectations view has a serious claim to empirical relevance.},

Methods Our study draws on a global data set and employs a model that takes into account the potential for selection bias in the adoption of SAPs by states. Results The central finding of the article is that SAPs in the short term raise the exposure of populations to conditions that increase incidences of disability and death. Contrary to the assertions made by the advocates of SAPs, we also find evidence that these programs have attenuated but still harmful effect on public health performance in the long term. Conclusions This study highlights the negative influences of SAPs on public health and suggests that a need exists to reevaluate the claims that have been made regarding the developmental effects of these programs.},

  abstract = {The disintegration of Yugoslavia was the result of many factors, not of a single one, but the main one was the breakdown of the ideological consensus within the Yugoslav political elite during an extended period of 15 years preceding the actual disintegration of Yugoslav institutions. The thesis examines the emergence, implementation, crisis and the breakdown of the fourth constitutive concept of Yugoslavia (1974-1990). Since the role of the political elite in this period was crucial, it is only by focussing on elite perceptions of reality that one can understand Yugoslav politics. More than any other work in the field, this thesis emphasises the link between elite and ideology (i.e., Kardelj's interpretation of Marxism). Using interviews with dozens of key political actors in this period, documents and other primary sources, the thesis reconstructs the elite's motives and reasons for first accepting then abandoning both Kardelj's interpretation and a fragile but viable compromise reached during the 1967-1974 Constitutional debate. The thesis is a historical case-study of the collapse of socialist Yugoslavia, but it makes contribution to other fields, such as: theories of state disintegration; the comparative politics of communist states; elite politics; the debate on ideology; politics in multi-ethnic societies; methodology of social sciences, etc. Its main novelty is in presenting new sources and offering an original interpretation of the events which happened in the analysed period. It also corrects some misconceptions in the debate on the collapse of Yugoslavia, such as the 'ethnic hatred' argument and various mono-causal explanations focussed on economic crisis, international politics, ethnic structure, etc. Their main fallacy is in neglecting the subjective, i.e., the perceptions of political actors in politics. The thesis demonstrates that institutions that were created on ideological grounds found it ultimately impossible to survive the collapse of the ideological narrative whose products they were.},

This article examines the repurposing of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to become the world's leading promoter of free markets. Social scientists commonly point to two modes of global-level institutional change: formal and fundamental transformations, like renegotiated treaties, or informal and incremental changes of a modest nature. The case of the IMF fits neither of these molds: it underwent a major transformation but without change in its formal foundations. Relying on archival material and interviews, the authors show that fundamental-yet-informal change was effected through a process of norm substitution---the alteration of everyday assumptions about the appropriateness of a set of activities. This transformation was led by the United States and rested on three pillars: mobilization of resources and allies, normalization of new practices, and symbolic work to stabilize the new modus operandi. This account denaturalizes neoliberal globalization and illuminates the clandestine politics behind its rise.},

This is somewhat unusual, given that socialist policy-makers have put great emphasis on equitable regional development. This article analyses the regional patterns of growth and divergence in socialist Yugoslavia. New estimates of output and inputs are constructed, and an analysis of output growth, factor accumulation, structural modernization, and productivity is provided. Two novel empirical findings are uncovered. The first is that the sources of growth across the regions were fundamentally different. Total factor productivity was a much more important source of growth in the richer regions than it was in the poorer ones. The second finding is that the source of the regional income divergence lies in the failure of the less developed regions to converge towards the employment rates and total factor productivities of the more developed regions. These failures are interpreted, at least partially, as symptoms of the governing objective and the soft budget constraint of the labour-managed firms that operated in Yugoslavia. It is argued that Yugoslavia's development model was less suited to the pre-conditions that prevailed in the less developed parts of the country.},

  publisher = {Cambridge University Press},
  abstract = {For decades Yugoslavia has been trying to develop its own model of socialism based on workers' self-management and increasing use of the market mechanism. As a result, many scholars view the Yugoslav economy as very different from other socialist systems. In this book, Dr Milica Uvalic shows, on the contrary, how some of the fundamental features of the Yugoslav economy have remained similar to those characterizing other socialist economies. Dr Uvalic focuses on theoretical and empirical issues related to investment in Yugoslavia since 1965. She examines investment policies, sources of finance, macroeconomic performance, enterprise incentives and current property reforms in relation to Western theory on investment behaviour in the labour-managed firm, and to Kornai's theory of socialist economies. In line with Kornai, the author reveals that, in spite of substantial institutional change, the investment process has continued to be characterized by an over-investment drive, severe capital market distortions and capital allocation according to non-market criteria, frequent state intervention in daily enterprise policies and limited enterprise autonomy, lack of financial discipline and the socialization of losses. The author argues that investment reforms have not led to substantially changed enterprise behaviour, which illustrates the limited results to be expected from partial reforms in a socialist economy. The fundamental causes of investment problems in Yugoslavia are thus typical of 'traditional' socialist economic systems, rather than the specific characteristic of self-management. Investment and property rights in Yugoslavia is a most topical work. It presents a great deal of new material and addresses issues that have previously been dealt with in isolation. It will be widely read by students and specialists of Eastern Europe, comparative economic systems and finance.},

  abstract = {Yugoslavia was well positioned at the end of the cold war to make a successful transition to a market economy and westernization. Yet two years later, the country had ceased to exist, and devastating local wars were being waged to create new states. Between the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 and the start of the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina in March 1992, the country moved toward disintegration at astonishing speed.The collapse of Yugoslavia into nationalist regimes led not only to horrendous cruelty and destruction, but also to a crisis of Western security regimes. Coming at the height of euphoria over the end of the cold war and the promise of a "new world order," the conflict presented Western governments and the international community with an unwelcome and unexpected set of tasks. Their initial assessment that the conflict was of little strategic significance or national interest could not be sustained in light of its consequences. By 1994 the conflict had emerged as the most challenging threat to existing norms and institutions that Western leaders faced. And by the end of 1994, more than three years after the international community explicitly intervened to mediate the conflict, there had been no progress on any of the issues raised by the country's dissolution.In this book, Susan Woodward explains what happened to Yugoslavia and what can be learned from the response of outsiders to its crisis. She argues that focusing on ancient ethnic hatreds and military aggression was a way to avoid the problem and misunderstood nationalism in post-communist states. The real origin of the Yugoslav conflict, Woodward explains, is the disintegration of governmental authority and the breakdown of a political and civil order, a process that occurred over a prolonged period. The Yugoslav conflict is inseparable from international change and interdependence, and it is not confined to the Balkans but is part of a more widespread phenomenon of politic},

  abstract = {In the first political analysis of unemployment in a socialist country, Susan Woodward argues that the bloody conflicts that are destroying Yugoslavia stem not so much from ancient ethnic hatreds as from the political and social divisions created by a failed socialist program to prevent capitalist joblessness. Under Communism the concept of socialist unemployment was considered an oxymoron; when it appeared in postwar Yugoslavia, it was dismissed as illusory or as a transitory consequence of Yugoslavia's unorthodox experiments with worker-managed firms. In Woodward's view, however, it was only a matter of time before countries in the former Soviet bloc caught up with Yugoslavia, confronting the same unintended consequences of economic reforms required to bring socialist states into the world economy. By 1985, Yugoslavia's unemployment rate had risen to 15 percent. How was it that a labor-oriented government managed to tolerate so clear a violation of the socialist commitment to full employment? Proposing a politically based model to explain this paradox, Woodward analyzes the ideology of economic growth, and shows that international constraints, rather than organized political pressures, defined government policy. She argues that unemployment became politically "invisible," owing to its redefinition in terms of guaranteed subsistence and political exclusion, with the result that it corrupted and ultimately dissolved the authority of all political institutions. Forced to balance domestic policies aimed at sustaining minimum standards of living and achieving productivity growth against the conflicting demands of the world economy and national security, the leadership inadvertently recreated the social relations of agrarian communities within a postindustrial society.},
