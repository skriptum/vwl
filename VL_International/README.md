## Trade

History:

- international trade steadily rising until 2009
    - first wave oif "globalization" around 1900
    - and second wave at the start of the '80s
- only interrupted during recessions

### Gains from Trade

Trade = mutual benefits, developed by Ricardo

- specialization = comparative advantage
- abundant resources can be exported
- Intertemporal trade (lending / borrowing)

But:

- particular groups affected = *losers of globalization*
    - i.e workers compete with workers in other regions
- creates inequality!



### Patterns of Trade

describes flow of goods

- differences in climate and resources
- labor productivity
- relative supply (labor, capital, land)



### Policys on Trade

- Tariffs
- Quotas
- Export subsidies
- other (product regulations...)



## Finance

- trade involves monetary flows
- exchange of financial goods = can make better off



### Balance of Payments

Measurement of Financial Assets (Inflow / Outflow)

> **Official Settlements balance**: measure of balance of funds  central banks uses for international payments



### Exchange Rate

how much domestic currency exchanged for international currency

- import of goods
- export of goods
