- understanding of dialectic between
    - individual choice
    - collective identity
    - structural inequality
- critical exploration of power
- broad interest (household, family, community), not just market

FPE:

- no separation between public and private
- patriarchy as fundamental to capitalism
- plurality of methodological approaches
- interconnected with feminist movements
    - first wave feminism: suffragettes
    - second wave feminism: 60s liberation



### Global Perspective

- interconnectedness of crisis
- north south divide
- position of countries in global reproduction
- effects of coloniality 

### Renewed Interest

- after Marginal Revolution = economics was not broad anymore
- Political Economy = integration of social sciences back into the field
- 00s = rising inequality and crisis not described by classical econ

Feminist Political Economy similar to Feminist Economics!



### Economics and Men

- Economics = male dominated
- models = color blind
- *androcentric* 
- *homo oeconomicus*: egoistic men
