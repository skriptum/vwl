# 17.01.2024 Tax Ineffiencies

Tax system = balance **equity** and **efficiency**

without Taxes: Social Margin Benefit (SMB) = Social Marginal Cost (SMC)

with Taxes: Deadweight Loss, depends on

- Tax height
- elasticities (inelastic = lower DWL, higher tax rev)

## Deadweight Loss

DWL Formula (not relevant!)
$$
DWL = - \frac{ \eta_s \eta_d }{2(\eta_s - \eta_d)}\times \tau^2 \times \frac{ Q }{P}
$$

- $\eta$ = elasticities
- $\tau$ = Tax rate

Implications

1. effiency depends on *preexisting distortions*
    - e.g. taxing positive externalities = very inefficient
2. progressive tax system = higher DWL 
    - higher tax rate for rich = higher DWL
3. low long running taxes > short high taxes (e.g war financing)

empirical: **DWL is smaller than in theory!**

- individuals perceive taxes different
- they are used much better than private!

## Optimal Commody Taxation

by Frank Ramsay: ratio of marginal DWL = marginal Revenue

Formula:

$$
\frac{ MDWL_i }{MR_i} = \lambda
$$

ratio $\lambda$ = should besame for all goods

Example 

$$
\frac{ MDWL_A }{MR_A} > \frac{ MDWL_B }{MR_B}
$$

- increase taxation on B
- lower on A

-> elasticity rule: good with higher elast. = lower tax

- but not good for equity (caviar = high elast, wheat = low)

## Optimal Income Taxes

optimal syste,

- total income in society = fixed
- same utility function
- After = everyone same income



Lafffer Curve = bullshit, not empirical!

What to include in Tax Policy

- vertical equity = high tax on rich
- behavioral responses

Formula: $\frac{ MU }{MR} = \lambda$ same for all

## Tax-Benefit Linkages

> **Earmarked Taxes**: taxes collected and spent for specific purpose (e.g social insurance)

- lowers inefficiency
- benefits are distributed back

Example: benefits are valued same as tax loss
