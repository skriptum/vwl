# 5. History of the Gold Standard

Introduction
- Germany 1875,
- France 1878
- US 1900

First: UK = main economic power at the time

Gold-Standard 

- needs constant convertibility to anyone
- at any bank (not only CB)
- No devaluation / appreciation (fixed exchange rate)



Problem: 

- Inflation is determined by relative price of gold
- no influence on the price of gold of one country
-  fluctuations in gold market! 



### Assumptions in the Gold Standard

 *Hume* Theory 

- only goal = price stability
- capital movements = adjustment mechanism (gold)
- no trade barriers: free movement of goods between countries
- participating countries = approx. same size



What happens in an current account deficit?

- gold outflow
- money supply contraction: relative price of gold â†‘
- lower prices (no devaluation!)
- lower imports + more exports



### Reality of the Gold Standard

- Pound Sterling = international currency
- sterling = exchangable to gold

=> *gold points* (exchange rate boundaries)

- barriers where own currency => gold
- is prefereable to currency => sterling
- e.g when weak currency / depreciation



Therefore: 

- limit depreciation of currency
- otherwise gold would be used



Why Sterling?

- UK = biggest trader + clearing union + international financial hub
- silver = lighter than gold
- colonial / military power of the Crown


> **Clearing Union:** Settlement / Cancellation of bilateral Balances 


### Failure of the Gold Standard

- WW1
  - massive public spending => inflation
  - exchange rate pressure
- Additional reasons
  - trade barriers introduction
  - different size + one hegemon (UK)
  - price stability = not only focus
- downfall of the UK
  - ascension of the US + Germany (and their currencies)
  - Anti-colonial rise
