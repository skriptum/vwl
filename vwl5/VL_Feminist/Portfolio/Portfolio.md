## Introduction

Nobel Prize Cliffhanger

Presentation of the different chapters

## Motivation

- me = only neoclassical education
- no thinking about women
    - Only in one lecture shortly with a framework of gary Becker
    - Women as rational choice models devoid of discrimation and history
- wanted to learn more about historical perspectives
- develop a feeling fore the feminist school of thought in economics
- feelig of injustice aorung gender in society
    - not diectly personally affected
    - but trough gender norms still

## Learning Journey

Course

- fulfilled my hopes of learning more about gender injustices
- and also especially the eurocentrism of my current knowledge
    - white privileges
    - gender norms in different societies
- other concepts championed by Feminist Economists = informative
    - esp. Buen Vivir, completely different from western conceptions of utopia (e.g socialism)
    - incorporation of women into political alternatives
    - Hopeful 

- Challenging for me: Chapter in Book very basic
    - not deep in data / statistics
- from my bachelor more accommodated to data-heavy and sometimes boring slides full of graphs
- not in this lecture, which was more theoretical and narrative-based
    - difficult for me to adapt, feeling that the chapters may be lacking
    - wanted to know more about the data
- reflection process: maybe hanging together with my disdain for qualitative research
    - only teached quantitative in uni
    - therefore personally no knowledge in qualitative
    - see it as more primitive way of research (dumb)
- course opened my eyes to be more open toward it
    - especially Pipes, Profits Peace Text


another challenge = openness of the final paper

- never written a paper as a course exam in my study
- mostly used to Multiple Choice Exams
- degree of freedom in chosing topic = quite difficult



- on site weekends = very informative
    - sharing of personal expereinces by others in the group
    - good choice of texts, introduction into completely different topics
    - got to know more about this complex school of thought
    - good discussions 



Learnings of the course for future

- incorporate class / gender more into economic analyisis
- new perspective especially for intersectionality
    - Was not as present before
- better prepared for discussions with neoclassical economists
- find taste for qualitative research
    - not just quantiative view i had before





## Nobel Prize and Feminist Economics

Intro:

- this chapter = analyze Claudia goldins work from feminist economics perspective
- is claudia goldin feminist economist?
- nobel prize = sign of feminist economics in mainstream?



Nobel Prize of Sveriges Riksbank economics

- biggest achievement in Economics 
- historically only third women to receive (Goldin, Duflo, Ostrom)
- mostly to neoclassical / mainstream economics, altough some opening in recent years
    - behaviroal economics 
    - game theory
    - => nobel prize = incorporation into mainstream



about goldin

- educated at University of Chicago = heart of neoliberalism
- under Gary Becker (marginal choice analysis of women)
    - family as little factory
    - rational choice of number of work / kids
- infleunced heavily by 1970s womens movement
- 1972 phD
- first professor with tenure economics harvard
- pioneer? even though very classical education



Goldins Take on

- Household (Chapter 5)
    - analysis of Different earnings men and women
    - deviation of Gary Beckers Way
    - trajectories of pay after birth for father / mother (parenthood effect)
    - regular on Gender Pay Gap News Channels
        - But: no deviations from standard household
        - only white middle class women focused
        - no single parents etc...
        - rising share of non-common households therefore not included

- Labor-Market Inequality (Chapter 6)
    - Analysis for lower Inequality in 1950s etc.
    - demand for lower skilled workers
    - and war price controls

- historical perspective

    - disputed common perspective that progress => more women in labor
    - showed with new historical data that before industrialization = women more equal work

    - Goldins U


- Feminist Movements
    - newest paper (why women won)
    - describing fights of womens movement for rights
    - explains legal hurdles / societal obstacles overcome
    - also describes antifeminist movements (past + today)






and her not exisitng takes on (@Kesar)

- global south (not advanced economics)
- informal jobs more common there
- Class / Caste perspective



Research Ways change (@Small)

- shift to instituational economics
- cites feminist economists
- more textual / narrative than most neoclassical 
- historical analysis, not just mathematics



=> gradual movement into more heterodox direction

- started as neoclassical economist
- moved into new directiosn (institutionalist / feminist)
- new topics and research methods
- not yet fully FPE, but starting to cite them
- openend possibilities for more women in economics
    - Graduate Program onyl for women
- Nobel Prize = acknowledgement of this research in mainstream
    - more gaps open for more FPE in mainstream
    - maybe one day it will also be teached in mainstream economics
- i wouldnt need to take extra classes like this, but would be included in my curriculum
