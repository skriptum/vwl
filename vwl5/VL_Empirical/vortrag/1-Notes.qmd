# DDCG Notes

## Intro

-   Daron Acemoglu

-   James A Robinson

-   Suresh Naidu

-   Pascual Restrepo

published 2019, *Journal of Political Economy*

Problems for the question:

-   Democary Indices

-   institutional differences between Dem / non-Dem

-   correlation with other changes

-   slumps in GDP before democratization

=\>  DiD / panel data estimates not good idea

## Literature

*Notes here also from other papers*

Question dates back to 1959 (lipset hypothesis)

Lipset: $\text{economic growth} \to \text{democracy}$



1990s: 

- conitnius variables of democracy + simple regressions (OLS, problematic)
- (eg [@barroDemocracyGrowth1996]) 
- no clear /negative effect
- confirm Lipset hypothesis (growht => democracy)

Barro: $\text{democracy} \to \text{growth} \downarrow$

2000s:

- binary measures of democracy + Diff in Diff
- mixed / postiive / not significant effects
- eg [@giavazziEconomicPoliticalLiberalizations2005]

Giavazzi: $\text{democracy} \rightsquigarrow \text{growth}$

modern aproaches: Acemoglu

- different strategies
- as guess from Title: positive results

Acemoglu: $\text{democracy} \implies \text{growth}$

Meta Analysis [@colagrossiDoesDemocracyCause2020]

## Approaches

First:

-   country fixed effects

-   control with lags

    -   esp. pre-dem GDP dip

=\> ensure that deomcratizations are (conditionally) uncorrelated to past GDP

=\> robust estimates of 20% higher GDP pC after 25 years

Second:

-   semiparametric treatment effects framework

    -   statistical model to analyze treatment effect on outcome

    -   mix of parametric and non-parametric methods

    -   flexible approach

-   democratization influences distribution of potential GDP afterwards (time-dsitribution)

Third:

-   Instrumental Variable Approach

-   regional waves of democratization

    -   differ from economic shocks

**=\> all approaches 25% increase**

## Channels:

-   investment +

-   schooling +

-   economic reforms

-   public services +

-   social unrest -

**possible other Literature**

-   Schumpeter: theoretical arguments against

-   Barro: empirical arguments against

## Data

Democracy INdex (consolidated and dichotomous)

Sources:

-   [Freedom House](https://freedomhouse.org/) (free, partly free, unfree)

-   [Polity IV](https://www.systemicpeace.org/polity/polity4x.htm) (-10, +10)

-   Cheibub et al (@cheibubDemocracyDictatorshipRevisited2010)

-   Boix et al (@boixCompleteDataSet2013)

measure is also for short lived democracies!

either 0 or 1

Outcome Variable: log GDP p.C 2000 Dollars (World Bank)

## Regression

### First Approach

$$
y_{ct} = \beta D_t + E_{j=1}^p \gamma_j y_{ct-j} + \alpha_c + \delta_t + \epsilon_{ct}
$$

Formula: ...

-   $y_ct$ = log GDP per capita in country *c* at time *t*

-   $D_{ct}$ = Dichotomous measure of democracy

-   *p* lags of log GDP for control

-   $\alpha$ = country fixed effects

-   d = time fixed effects

-   $e$ = error

$$
\frac{ \hat\beta }{1- E_{j=1}^p \hat\gamma_j}
$$

lags = countries not on different GDP trends before (stop reverse causality)

Results: (Table 2) weirdly split on two pages

Estimators:

-   **within estimator** (aka [fixed effects model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_effects_model))

-   GMM estimator (@arellanoTestsSpecificationPanel1991)

-   HKK Estimates(@hahnBiasCorrectedInstrumental2001)

why switch?

-   Nickell Bias (not enough time periods compared to entities), always in within estimator

    -   just theoretical

    -   they have enough times, therefore ok

-   bias of fixed-effects estimator

-   use other methods, but not that widespread

    -   GMM has their own biases (asymptitic bias, too many Ts)

    -   HHK similar to first

**Robustness:**

-   omitted variable between GDP and Democracy

    -   other approaches

-   different levels of income before democratization

    -   solve by using just subsample with similar wealth

-   have dummy for post-soviet transition to democracy

-   other ommited variables controls:

    -   unrest before democracy is good for growth

        -   also controlled for in other approaches and lags of unrest

    -   external trade influences both

        -   control for external financial flows

    -   demographic changes

        -   also controlled for

### Second Approach

Prblem of First: linearity assumption of GDP growth

semi-parametric

-   no parametric assumption for GDP development

-   but assumption for likelihood of transition to democracy

Assumption:

-   transitions to democracy preceded by dip

-   no other confounding factors that influence propensity to democratize

Results:

-   confirmation of assumption

-   results similar to first approach

-   used three different methods

### Third Approach

waves of democratization

-   external factor that influences both demotracy and GDP

-   alleviates errors in democracy measure

-   regionally limited due to similiar politics  culture etc.

e.g Soviet Union fall

7 regions

1.  Africa

2.  East Asia + Pacifics

3.  Eastern Europe + Central Asia

4.  Western Europe + other developed countries

5.  Latin America + Carribean

6.  MENA

7.  South Asia

Wave definition

-   significant determinants of democracy

-   but wothout trend effect on GDP

=\> different Approach, but similiar estimates

## Mechanisms

potential channels and data

-   \% investment GDP (logs)

-   TFP (log)

-   measure of economic reform (Giuliano 2013) 0-100

-   \% trade GDP (log)

-   \% taxes of GDP (log)

-   primary school enrollment

-   secondary school enrollment

-   child mortality (log)

-   social unrest dummy

Estimation

$m_{ct} = \beta D_{ct} + \sum_{j=1}^p \gamma_j y_{ct-j} + \sum_{j=1}^p \eta_j m_{ct-j} + \alpha_c + \delta_t+\epsilon_{ct}$

Results: Democracy =\>

-   economic reforms

-   tax rev.

-   enrollment school

-   some evidence

    -   invstment

    -   opnennes to trade

    -   less social unrest

=\> Democracy: more taxes, more investment in school, econ. reforms

Critiqie of DDCG:

-   Dem. needs certain preconditions (human capital, institutions)

-   Team controls for

-   =\> high human capital (educated), democracy = more growth

    -   high ed. = reduce stakes of distributional conflicts

## Conclusion

Skepticism about democracy always existed (see Plato)

but effects of democarcy are there!

-   more than others argued (esp Barro)

## Critique

-   not enough explaining, why choose which specification

    -   in every approach choose the one that is most similar results to others

-   dichotomous democracy index

    -   democratization is a flowing element

-   regional analysis

    -   size  of regions

Linear Dynamic Panel Model

-   **Linear:** Assumes proportional relationships between variables.

-   **Dynamic:** Includes lagged values of the dependent variable to capture temporal dependencies.

-   **Panel:** Analyzes data with both cross-sectional (different entities) and time-series (observations over time) dimensions.

-   **Fixed Effects:** Incorporates parameters specific to each entity in the panel, capturing time-invariant characteristics.

-   **Model Purpose:** Used to analyze how changes in variables, such as GDP, relate to each other over time, considering individual entity characteristics and historical patterns.
