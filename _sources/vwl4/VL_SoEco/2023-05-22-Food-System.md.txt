# Resilience Food Systems

> **Global Food System**: Network of Activities and processes from production to consumption

Problems:

- Biodiversity Loss
- GHG Emissions
- Water Use
- Inefficient 
- Inequal distribution
- But: high productivity

=> calls for more resilience + transformation

Undesirable constraints:

- knowledge
	- About Effects on nature 
- Investment
	- „First mover disadvantage“
- policies
	- Subsidies / tariffs
	- Unpopular price hikes
- Sociocultural
	- expectation cheap food
	- Direct costs not in price
- Biophysical
	- Water and chemcial use

= undesirable resilience

Change:
- occurs most often in crisis
	- „window of opportunity“
- without rebound
