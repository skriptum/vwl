- core depends on extraction from periphery => underdevelopment

**Core**: Industrialized with Firms, Labor Unions, Rich

**Periphery**: Dual Structure, Extraction



### History

- land expropriation + slave trade => **plantation economy**
    - division of labor on global scale
- alliances between convicts and slaves = stopped with racism
- reproduction
    - at first: reproduction limited, due to cost to slave owner
    - after ban on slave trade: actively encouraged to grow population
- trade relations = unequal to this day
    - prodution at begin 20th Century = determinant of current income
    - net transfer from south to north
