# 3. International Monetary System

### IMS Requirements

- convertible currency
- capital mobility
- legal system stability
- liquidity management rules
- external imbalance arrangements (floating, CB role etc.)



### Evaluation Criteria

- confidence
- stability
- ability to have *independent monetary policy*
- limited functional costs
- should allow balancing different goals
  - *internal balance:* low unempl. <-> inflation
  - *external balance*: trade equilibrium
  - *financial balance*: no BOP crisis 



## Balance of Payments

> **Balance of Payments (BOP)**: statement of all transactions made by entities (between them and rest od the world)

- all types of transactions
- quantity + value of products
- balance to 0 (accounting truth)



### Accounts

> **Current Account**: all transactions in terms of goods, services, income, asset transfers

= mostly imports / exports

> **capital account:** transactions of financial instruments / central bank reserves / monetary transfers



Exchange Rate effects (on current account)

- **Volume Effect** of ER â†‘
  -  less foreign currency = less imports
  - Foreigners = more domestic currency = more exports
- **Value Effect**: relative price of the good



Which effect dominates?

- depends on elasticity (Marshall-Lehner condition)
  - higher elasticity = volume effect dominates
  - lower elasticity = value effect
- J-curve:
  - very short run: value effect
  - slower adjustment of imp. / exp.



## Reserve currencies

> **Reserve Currency**: currency that is held in significant quanitty by CB & Institutions as part of foreign exchange reserves

- used in int. trade / transactions
- used by CB to impact ER
- asset function



Advantages

- easy international trade
- ease of borrowing in your own currency
- lower ER (not exchaning that much)



Disadvantages

- speculative bubbles
- difficulty to maintain internal / external balances (*Triffin Dilemma*)
  - produce a lot of currency to make world happy (trouble exporting + inflation)
  - or protect economy (less currency available to foreigners)
