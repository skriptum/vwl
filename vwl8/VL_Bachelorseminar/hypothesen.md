## Hypotheses

Time Period: 2011-2021

- after 2020: covid housing irregularities
- before 2011: no data 



Descriptive

- Gains from housing: inequal in different percentiles 
  - absolute and relative
- absolute rise: share of the different percentiles captured
- owner-tenant wealth ratio go up
- wealth inequality movement?
  - decomposition by housing / other assets
  - abatement movements other assets
- countries with fastest rising house prices -> rising inequality
  - simple regression
- other Data: 
  - housing prices (before and after period)
    - european comparison



Econometric

- germany without housing price boom
  - less inequality
  - construct SCM with European neighbours, e.g. italy
- Lermanâ€“Yitzhaki decomposition
  - does rise in housing wealth => rise in inequality
  - contribtion of housing wealth to inequality


Problems

- Gini / Theil Coefficient Calculation from deciles
- SCM Critique: new methods
