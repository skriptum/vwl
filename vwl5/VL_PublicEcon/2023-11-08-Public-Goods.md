## Optimal Provision

How much should the society provide?

- Aggregate demands (here two individuals)
- add Demands at each point (**vertically**)

Mathematically: Ben and Jerrys Demand

$$
MRS_{m,c}^B + MRS_{m,c}^J = MC
$$

## Private Provision

Problem: Underprovision due to **Free Rider Problem** = Market Failure

Possible Situations_

- some care more than others
- people are altruistic
- people have **warm glow** from others (like seeing other people happy)

Solution: 

- overcome non-excludability
- charge user the fees

=> often does not work!

## Public Provision

Problems:

- Crowd Out
- Provision Mechanism
- Measuring Costs / Benefits
- measuring individual preferences
