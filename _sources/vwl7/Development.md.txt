## Middle Income Countries - New Challenges, Same old Answers?



### Intro

- Nobel prize 2024 - Acemoglu et al (**REF** AJRR Paper)
- Research on what causes Growth in the long run - institutions
- Growing interest, also visible - WB Report



- no shortage of recommendations for middle income countries historically
- especially from western neoliberal institutions like World Bank
  - wahsington consensus
  - same prescriptions to countries
  - lower txes, more trade, more FDI
  - no regard for the politics of it = low success rates
  - **REF**: Shock Therapy Naomi Klein
- argue, that the WDR partly follows that tradition



### Policy Examples in the Report

Generally: 

- new approach: 
  - formerly: only focus on investment + innovation
  - the middle stage of infusion was lost
- but: mostly supply side issues addressed
  - capital, labor supply
- less talking about demand side issues
  - inequality
  - wages
  - Includes: social mobility, esp for women + minorities

=> better than earlier reports



two countries play a mayor role in report: Poland and Korea

### Poland:

- praised for disciplining of SOE
- hardening the socialist "soft budget constraint"
- accession to EU = important part of the process
- completely omitting the hard realities and politics caused by shock therapy
  - drop in real wages and living standards (5 years to recoup)
  - one of the most equal to inequal countries (doubling of share of top10%)
    - **REF:** WID
  - partly led to success of PIS Party  (Lindner, Piketty et al 2021)
- = the political economy of the recommonedations is dropped completely



### South Korea

- praised for infusion of technology from outside
- part. *Chaebols* (family owned businesses) -> conglomerates
- aadapted to innovation and technological frontier
- but: **REF?**
  - today: monopoly power
  - ability to set prices to supply chains
  - WDR recommends antitrust + competition
  - but very hard to to, after there is a huge monopolization of the economy 
  - 5 firms = 50% of stock value (**REF** Council on Foreign Relations 2018) 
  - political entrenchment + corruption scandal, dismiss of last president
- = conflicting recommendations, fictious separation of economy + politics



### China

- notable omission from report
- arguably the greatest success story of development
  - reductio. of extreme poverty of 300million
  - not a HIC, but the best example of what to do
- neither the often cited Acemoglu et al nor WB report can explan
  - China in ANRR = miracle / exception to rule (**REF** WNF) 
  - no democracy, one party rule = extractive
  - but still remarkable growth experience
  - WDR policies = mostly not followed at all (recommendations on last page)
- How: different polices, not shock therapy: **REF** Isabella Weber
- not explained at all = inconclsive policy of growth if you cant really explain the largest growth happening in history
  - Infusion trough IP theft
  - heavy (wasteful) subsidization
  - crony capitalism (by some standards)



### Conclusion

World Bank Report = gives some ideas

- notably mostly supply side 
- omission of inequality 

Problem: new challenges

- climate change accelerating 
  - large scale subsidies needed for transformation
  - not advised by WB
- protectionism by high income countries

We still dont understand growth and how exactly to do it

- a lot of research needed
- the same ideas as the last 30 years wont help us more
- repackaged in a new report
- new policies are needed
