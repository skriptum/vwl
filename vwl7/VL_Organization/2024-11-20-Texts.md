## Paper 1: Nature of the Firm

Introduction - Author, context, source (150 words approx.)

“The Nature of the Firm” is an article written in 1937 by the British economist Ronald Harry Coase and published in the journal Economica. In the article, Coase examines the nature of the firm and the reasons for its existence in a specialized exchange economy. 

Neoclassical Theory at the Time argued that the price and market should be the main distribution mechanism, and firms were regarded as a black box without relevance to the economic profession. At the same time, socialist theories stated that a planned economy where all is planned by a central authority are preferable.

However, Coase argues that firms emerge to reduce the costs of using the price mechanism, such as the costs of information gathering, contract negotiation and uncertainty. But they should not grow above a certain size, as in a planned economy.

Coase argues that firms emerge to reduce the costs of using the price mechanism, which he calls “transaction costs”. These costs include:

- Information costs: The search for relevant prices on the market is associated with costs
- Negotiation costs: Contracts must be negotiated and concluded for each individual transaction on a market
- Costs of uncertainty: Long-term contracts are associated with uncertainty due to the difficulty of predicting future developments

Coase notes that by replacing a series of market transactions with a single business decision, companies reduce these transaction costs. Within a company, resources are not allocated by the price mechanism, but by the instructions of the entrepreneur.  The entrepreneur assumes the function of coordination and planning, which is fulfilled on the market by the price mechanism.

The size of a firm is determined by the relative cost of organizing transactions within the firm compared to the cost of carrying out these transactions through the market.  A firm will expand until the cost of organizing an additional transaction within the firm equals the cost of conducting the same transaction on the open market.

Coase identifies three main factors that influence the size of a company:

- Diminishing returns of the entrepreneurial function: As the size of a company increases, the cost of organizing additional transactions increases
- Probability of error: As the number of transactions increases, the likelihood that the entrepreneur will make errors in resource allocation increases
- Rising factor prices:  Prices of factors of production may increase as the size of the firm increases, as smaller firms may offer “other advantages”

Coase further argues that uncertainty is a necessary condition for the emergence of firms.  In a world without uncertainty, the price mechanism would be perfectly efficient and there would be no need for firms.  The existence of uncertainty causes the prediction of future needs and the coordination of production to be concentrated in the hands of a small group of producers - the entrepreneurs.

In summary, Coase's “The Nature of the Firm” was a seminal work that extended neoclassical theory by providing an explanation for the existence and size of firms.  His focus on transaction costs and the role of the entrepreneur has strongly influenced the further development of economic theory, especially in the areas of transaction cost economics and new institutional economics.

Coase's Ideas are becoming especially relevant in todays economy, as new technologies brought a significant reduction in transaction costs, which therefore could reduce the importance of large firms. (World Development Report 2019: THE CHANGING NATURE OF WORK). 

An example is the new platform / gig economy exemplified by Amazon or Fiverr, that reduced the cost of outsourcing and therefore allowed firms to grow in output without the headcount. This created a lot of new problems, as this new systems just transfer the uncertainty that before was faced by firms onto the individual gig workers, who have to juggle economic cycles and finding clients, while the firms enjoy maximum flexibility. In the older system, the workers enjoyed job security, because the firms needed their non-marketable knowledge and union organizing was more efffective in a large firm. 

Additionally, this type of company, that relies on a lot of external inputs is more susceptible to external shocks. If you outsource a lot of work to other companies, it introduces a lot ot uncertainty. This may have worked in the "Great Moderation", the period of long stability up to the Great Financial Crisis, but as the following crisis showed, reacting to this if you dont have any in-house knowledge anymore gets much more difficult. So the idea introduced by Coase that uncertainty playes a role, was somehow ignored in the name of "just in time" and "lean" management. 

Another thought I had concerning the Text is the role of socialist firms in his thinking. The 1930s were a period, where even in the West many intellectuals looked towards the Soviet Union for not being affected by the Financial Crisis of the 1930s like the US or the capitalist Europe. Coase was one of them (https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-011-5350-8_10) and his text clearly provides some  justification for the socialist mode of production, that is a planning at the firm level and not the "holy" market mechanism. 



## Paper 2: 

Introduction - Author, context, source (150 words approx.)

Karl E. Weick’s The Collapse of Sensemaking in Organizations: The Mann Gulch Disaster (1993) examines the breakdown of organizational coherence during the 1949 Mann Gulch fire, where 13 firefighters perished. Weick revisits the incident, using it as a case study to explore the fragility of sensemaking and role structures within temporary organizations. The study is grounded in the framework of organizational studies, emphasizing how ambiguity, minimal structures, and sudden disruptions can escalate into catastrophic failures.

Weick proposes four pillars of organizational resilience—improvisation, virtual role systems, an attitude of wisdom, and respectful interaction—as potential safeguards against such disintegration. This work builds on Norman Maclean’s narrative in Young Men and Fire (1992) but critically reinterprets the events through the lens of organizational theory. Weick’s analysis remains influential in understanding how human and systemic factors interact under crisis conditions.

**Main ideas of the Author + examples / illustrations (500 words approx.)**

Weick analyzes the Mann Gulch disaster to understand why organizations fail under pressure, focusing on the breakdown of sensemaking. He argues that sensemaking—the process of interpreting and responding to a situation—collapsed due to the disintegration of roles, mounting confusion, and individual panic. 

Weick describes the smokejumpers as a "minimal organization," functioning with basic coordination and routines. However, when confronted with unexpected danger, their role structures unraveled. For instance, when foreman Wagner Dodge told his crew to drop their tools—a shocking order that stripped them of their firefighter identity—many could not process the command and hesitated. Similarly, Dodge’s creative solution of lighting an escape fire was dismissed as irrational, illustrating how sensemaking failed at a critical moment. Without shared understanding or trust, the group fragmented, leading to catastrophic consequences.

Weick uses this disaster to propose ways organizations can build resilience to prevent similar collapses. First, he emphasizes the value of improvisation and bricolage—thinking creatively under pressure. Dodge’s escape fire was a textbook example of improvisation, yet its effectiveness was lost because the group lacked the context to trust or adopt it. Resilient organizations, he argues, encourage adaptability and innovation even in high-stress situations.

Next, he introduces the idea of virtual role systems, where individuals internally simulate the roles of others to maintain coordination, even when structures fail. If the crew members had been able to mentally adopt Dodge’s perspective, they might have understood his tactics and survived. 

Weick also stresses the attitude of wisdom, a balance between confidence and doubt. The smokejumpers’ overconfidence in treating the fire as a routine "10:00 fire" (one that could be extinguished by morning) blinded them to its real dangers. Organizations must acknowledge uncertainty and remain open to reevaluating assumptions in the face of new information.

Lastly, Weick highlights the importance of respectful interaction. Building trust and clear communication in teams creates a foundation for collaboration, especially in crises. Sallee and Rumsey, the two survivors who fled through a crevice, exemplify this principle—they stuck together and coordinated their escape, illustrating the power of maintaining even a small group dynamic.

Through the Mann Gulch analysis, Weick paints a picture of how minimal disruptions in role clarity and communication can snowball into disaster. His proposed solutions—improvisation, mental role systems, wisdom, and interaction—offer practical strategies for fostering resilience in organizations. The lesson is clear: when facing chaos, organizations must prepare not just with plans, but with the capacity to adapt and stay connected under pressure.

Example: applied to fall of the Berlin Wall

- Gunther Schabowski = "jederzeit, unverzüglich"
- DDR clearly in crisis, he was in a stressful situations
- information was 

"which reporters were told what to write after events had already  happened. Thus, he found it somewhat difficult to get used to  Western-style media practice"

- unprepared for situatio (like 10:00 fire)

"all one needed to do to conduct a press conference was to be able to speak German and read a text without mistakes"

- when question came when it started: no clear answer, mumbling around
- create expectations in group (18 million east germans)
- "spread like fire" over TV

One example that directly came to my mind is the 9th of November and the fall of the berlin wall as a clear consequence of the actions of Gunther Schabowski. In a televised press conference to western journalists, he stated that the opening of the border happens "unverzüglich" (immediatey, contrary to the official rule that it does not take place. After that, millions of east germans flooded the border guards and the GDR de facto stopped to exist.

The situation was clearly a stressful one, he was not briefed on the exact content of the policy change and did not prepare enough. And especially the western-style media conference was difficult with his background as a east german journalist, where "reporters were told what to write after events had already  happened. Thus, he found it somewhat difficult to get used to  Western-style media practice".  This is similar to the expectation of a 10:00 fire for the smokerangers, a misunderstanding of the situation. 

Then the question came, when the new policy would start, for which he did not have a clear answer in his mind or on his page. This question contradicted his stance on media appearences, when he before stated that all one needed to do to conduct a press conference was to be able to speak German and read a text without mistakes". So in searching for an answer, he mumbled the consequential words of "unverzüglich". 

It created high expectations in the rest of the group (18 Million East Germans) and instlantly hundreds of thousands flocked to the border gates in east Berlin. They got passage just hours after the TV news spread like wildfire and ended the dictatorial GDR. All this just because of missing information, a stressful situation and an unrprepared leader.
