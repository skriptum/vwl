# 15.11.2023 Cost Benefit Analysis

> **CBA:** Comparison of Costs / Benefits of public goods / projects to decide if they should be undertaken

## Measuring Costs

Example Costs:

- Capital Costs
- Operation C.
- Maintenance C.
- Non-Monetary C.

but very important: 

- Opportunity Costs!
- Rents



### Opprotunity Costs in imperfect markets

- Project Hours = 500.000
- project wage = 25$
- but real comp. wage = 20$

$$
Opportunity \ Cost = hours * comp. wage = 10.000.000
$$

### Discounting

how to count costs over time? discount value 

$$
PDV = \frac{ F_1 }{1+r}+\frac{ F_2 }{(1+r)^2}+\frac{ F_3 }{(1+r)^3}+...
$$

Choice of r = very important

- 1% UBA
- 7% US Government 



## Measuring Benefits

### Value of Time Savings

Approaches;

- Martket based = wages
    - time savee = valuet at wage
    - problems: nonmonetary aspects of job
- survey based
    - hypothetical questions 
    - embedding effect = difficulty to value things in larger context
    - people dont know their valuations
- revealed preferences
    - market prices = reveal the individual preferences
    - bias problem



Types of Revealed Preferences

- Hedonic Market Analysis = regression with a lot of controls
- Natural Experiments = naturally occuring variation in prices, how much people want to wait
    - e.g.: different prices at gas stations, but longer queues 

### Value of Lives saved

= most difficult issue 

## Critique of CBA

not part of the lectr√∫re, but very important ([Wiki-Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost%E2%80%93benefit_analysis#Criticisms))

**Distribution**

- no account of dsitribution issues
- only net-benefit for all people (Kaldor Hicks)
- utilitarian approach (1$ for 1 million people worse than 2 million to one person)

**Discounting**

- discounting value of benefits to future generations
- ignore preferences of future generation

**Marginal Utility**

- rich people = lower marginal utility
- no symmetry in agents
