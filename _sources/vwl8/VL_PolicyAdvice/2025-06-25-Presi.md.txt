## Main Findings

Our evaluation of this Paper:

- Ranks high on Maryland Scientific Methods Scale

- Creative use of RDD
- some criticism concerning transparency, literature treatment and robustness check



## Related Literature

- lot of literature on the topic (contested policy debate)
- mostly looking at overall economic effects in a region
  - oerview paper by coates and humphreys = no significant effect
- some sectoral analysis
  - fedderson maenning: world cup 2006
- some explanations:
  - substittion effects: consumers have limited sport budget = if football not there, just switch to other sports
  - export / import effects: if no sports in one region, go to another etc

this is the literature

consensus: **temporally, sectorally and geographically bounded** economic effects



## Data

Paper: uses valid data sources

- from 1995 - 2012
- 16 seasons, four leagues (Italy, Fracne, Germany, UK)
- attendance Data: http://european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn.htm
  - data sources of this website not revealed
  - not official statistics, consumer collected
  - often used in research
- NUTS 3 Level regional economic data
  - problem: broad categories of sectors
  - only focused on: Wholesale, Retail, Accommodation,...





## Results

### H1

**Effect of Relegation on club income** (Variable = attendance)



Plot: typical for RDD

- Cutoff
- see the discontinuity around cutoff

- 28% decrease relative

- plotted with a polynomial of 4th order





---

- but is this a valid Variable for Club Income?
  - no specific data on this on club level
  - but especially in germany: a lot of clubs in second league that have more visitors than first
  - due to famous clubs in 2nd (HSV, BSC, etc)
- and corporate clubs without many fans in 1st (RBL)
- differential effects in different countries?
  - not transparent in the analysis that some may have heavier effect than others



### H2

**effect of relegation on football related sectors**

Hypotheses 2: confirmed

- regional GVA & Employment
- very broad categories of economic sectors 
- not as statistically significant as before
- 3% reduction in sectors in relegated regions

### H3

**effect of relegation on overall economic growth**

Hypotheses 3: partially confirmed

- no relevant regional growth effects 
- but employment effects (p only 0.1 = statistical superfluous)
  - at least in the short term tested here
  - limited statististical significance

### summary

Sectoral, geographically, temporal effects

- short run differences in related sectors
- but very subtle

probably: Substitution



## Discussion

- Overfitting of Polynomial 4 to show a cutoff (esp H2 Figure)
  - @gelmanWhyHighOrderPolynomials2019
  - only visual element
- Bandwidth around Cutoff changes in every regression
  - automatically calculated
  - comparibility of regressions harmed
  - impairs the interpretation
- differential effects in different leagues
  - not mentioned in the paper
  - our guess: very different in UK vs germany (relegation attendance)



## Conclusion

- meaningful evidence
  - innovative RDD to real world data
  - SMS Level 4 (fulfills all )
    - Cutoff sufficiently sharp :white_check_mark:
    - only treatment changes at the boundary :ballot_box_with_check:
    - no manipulation around cut off :white_check_mark:
  - discussion = not complete criticism, 
    - just light improvements we would have wished
  - for us: training session in being critical of a paper





MARIOS:

- Relevance for Policy Advice
  - sector-specific, short-term effects of sports franchises
  - inform public subsidy decisions (e.g., infrastructure, policing)
  - Reinforces skepticism toward overstated ex-ante projections
- some Criticism, nonetheless good
  - McCrary Test
  - Econometric Inconsistencies
