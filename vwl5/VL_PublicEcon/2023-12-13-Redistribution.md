# 13.12.2023 Redistribution

two Types of Redistributional Policies

## Welfare Policy

Types of Welfare Programs

- **Categorical** Welfare: by demographic characteristic (e.g Kindergeld)
- **Means-tested** Welfare: by income limits (e.g Wohngeld)

=> many are both (e.g Bürgergeld)

Deliverance Types:

- **Cash**: direct cash, with beenfit guarantee and reduction rate
- **In-kind**: goods to recipients



Problem: some money lost on the ways (*Leaky Bucket Problem*)

- admini strative costs
- deadweight loss of taxation
- moral hazard of poor people

​	

### Moral Hazard in TANF

Benfit Formula


$$
B = G-(\tau \times w \times h)
$$

- G = maximum benefit
- $\tau$ = reduction rate
- $w$ = wae
- $h$ = hours worked

Individual Responses at $\tau = 0.5$

=> Benefits lead to Working Hours Reduction

= Iron Triangle of welfare 

- encourage work
- resdistribute more
- lowe costs

Choose only 2!

## Overcoming problems

### Categorical Welfare 

Target People based on their category

Requirements:

- linked to earnings capacity
- not changeable

e.g: Single Motherhood, Blindness



### Ordeal Mechanisms

make welfare unattractive = make people reveal earnings capacity

Example Mechanisms

- work / training requirements
- In-kind instead of cash

### Outside Option

reduce attractiveness of welfare by improving outside option (e.g wage niveau)

Methods:

- training
- minimum wage
- labor market subsidies
- subsidize child care
- force alimony payments (Unterhaltszahlungen für Alleinerziehende)





## Universal Basic Income 

**Idea**: every individual receives regular transfer payment

Advantages:

- eliminate poverty
- no tax on labor income

Disadvantage:

- reduce work trough income effect
- expensive



Empirical Results (Finland)

- only for unemployed
- small / no employment change
- Higher Satisfaction
- happiness up
