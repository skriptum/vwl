# PPP and Monetary Regimes

## Purchasing Power Parity

### absolute PPP

$$
r_{i,o} = \frac{P_i}{P_j}
$$

r = exchange rate

### relative PPP

$$
\frac{r_{i,j}^{t}}{r_{i,j}^{t-1}} = \frac{P_j^t}{P_j^{t-1}}/\frac{P_i^j}{P_i^{t-1}}
$$ 

allows for differential in inflation dynamics

### real exchange rate

$$
r_{I,J} = q(P_{I}/ P_J)
$$

with q = nominal exchange rate

## Exchange Rates

Determinants in the long run:

- inflation differentials
- degree of competition
- monetary policies
- productivity differential
	- higher prod = lower prices = higher PP
- Balassa-Samuelson Effect
	- price of services cheaper in LDC

Short Run: (financial variables)

- return on domestic assets
- return on foreign assets
- interest rate differentials

**Interest Rate Parity (IRP)**
$$
t_{i}= t_{j} - \frac{r_{i,j}^{t+1}-r_{ij}^{t+1}}{r_{ij}^t}
$$
with t = interest rates and r = exchange rates

- *uncovered IRP* = not taking into account exchange risk
- *covered IRP* = protecting with CDS

## Monetary Regimes

1. **Fixed** Exchange Rates
	- maintained by CB
	- pegged to basket of currencies / gold
	- CB needs reserves to answer demand
2. **floating** Exchange Rates
3. **dollarization** = currency of another country is legal tender
4. **Monetary Union**
5. **Currency Board**
	- domestic currency pegged to foreign currency
	- restrictions on monetary authority
	- e.g CFA-Franc
6.  Different Types of Pegs
	- horizontal bands
	- crawling pegs
	- managed floating without predetermined path

**Holy Trinity**

- fixed exchange rate
- independent monetary policy 
- perfect capital mobility
