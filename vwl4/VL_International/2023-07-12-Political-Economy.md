## Arguments

### Case for Free Trade

- lower prices
- efficient allocation, competition
- economies of scale

### Case against Free Trade

- better terms of trade trough tariffs
- big country can be beneficial
- optimal tax rate and export subsidy exists
- domestic market failures (unempl. underutilization)

But: unintended consequences, market failures other options better





## Political Model of Trade Policy

### Median Voter

Assumptions:

- Two-Party Democracy
- Obejctive: majority vote

Parties in Democracies pick position of voter in middle of political spectrum

Effect should be: Consumers > producers, free trade

### Collective Action

> a group has incentive to advocate for issue, but each individual close to no incentive

- e.g consumers can save big money, but each individual consumer only 10 cent
- Therefore special interests > collective action
