## 1) 

Best Repsonse Curve

- higher childcare subsidys for working people: 
    - more effort
    - reservation wage decreases (cost of job loss higher)
    - $\gets$ BRC
        - lower reservation wage and higher effort!
- higher demnd for firms output
    - No Effect on Reservation Wage!
    - no Effect on BRC
- improved technology
    - effort $\uparrow$, no effect on reservation wage
    - BRC rotates (to left)

**=> RBC only moves with Reservation Wage or effort!**

Reality: workers only Effort, but never lesser wage! (sticky wages)



## 2

Profit of Firm
$$
\Pi = \underbrace{p \cdot f(zeH)}_{revenue} - \underbrace{wH}_{cost}
$$

- H = hours per week
- z = Technology
- e = effort
- w = wage
- p = price
- f() = production function

 Effort Function: 
$$
e = E(w) = \Big(\frac{w-v}{v}\Big)^a
$$

- v = outside option (e.g unemployment benefits)
- a = degree of substitution

Diff w.r.t. $w$
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\delta \Pi}{\delta w} &= p \cdot f'(zE(w)H) * zE'(w)H- 1H = 0 \\
&= \bigg[p f'\big(zE(w)H\big)*zE'(w)-1\bigg]H = 0 \\
&= p f'(zE(w)H)*zE'(w) = 1
\end{aligned}
$$

## 3)

Decrease in Unemployment Benefit

- higher effort for every wage
- BRC to left

Monitoring Device

- increasing effort at given wage
- detection of shriking more likely
- BRC upwards

Decrease in Disutility of Working 

- more effort at every wage
