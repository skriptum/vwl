## Consistency

estimator is consistent when: 

- approaches true population parameter
- variance $\downarrow$



## Asymptotic Normality

What happens, when samples are not normally distributed? (e.g Lotto)

Solution: large samples  (they have *asymptotic normality*)

Testing: stays the same



## Asymptotic Efficiency

Estimator is efficient if

- consistency
- asymptotic normally distributed
- asymptatic vairance <= smaller than other estimators

OLS = asymptotically efficient!
