    - Primary Input = Time
- scarce resource = time & income

Focus on Comparative Advantage

- drives specialisation in specific activities
- lower OC of low-paid member => focus on care work

- Paradox of altruism in HH and selfish in market
    - why not selfish in HH?
- HH labor is not substitutable 
    - male labor does not subst. when women work more wage-labour
- Income Pooling

    - Individual incomes => not maximize HH welfare
- stark focus on heterosexual nuclear families
