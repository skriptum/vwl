# Agrico - Organizational Theory

## Introduction

Agricultural Collective

- situated in Leipzig, Germany
- based on Idea of CSA (Community Supported Agriculture)
  - non-market prices = induce more organizational / human challenges than typical anonymous market relationsip
  - explore in this essay

### General Overview

> Community Supported Agriculture (CSA), one type of direct marketing,  consists of a community of individuals who pledge support to a farm  operation so that the farmland becomes, either legally or spiritually,  the community's farm, with the growers and consumers providing mutual  support and sharing the risks and benefits of food production
>
> ~ Definition [USDA](https://www.nal.usda.gov/farms-and-agricultural-production-systems/community-supported-agriculture)



AgriCo

- direkt marketing
  - no intermediaries between farm and consumers 
- community of individuals
  - only start after a certain size of supporters pledge
  - build indidvudals into a "group"
- connection between growers and consumers
  - see AgriCo as part of their life
  - directly know the farmer and processes
  - pledge to work in harvest season on the farm
- risk + benefits sharing
  - farms = faced with weather / market risks
  - Consumers = get share of farm output (e.g 1/100th), not certain quantities of products 
  - vote in operations of the coop (yearly)
  - subscription type CSA [AATRAC 2006](https://we.riseup.net/assets/5009/attra+csa.pdf)



Existing Problems of CSA

- self-exploitation of growers
  - have the feeling of being indebted to the customer
  - long workinng hours at lower pay
  - Exploitation Problem [Paper](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ecge.12015)
- low diversity of produced food + rigidity on membership duration
- loew engagement of customers (and when, women)
  - Perceptions CSA (Human Organization [Journal](https://doi.org/10.17730/humo.59.2.715203t206g2j153))
- price / variability of goods
- low retention rate ([Huntley](http://web.archive.org/web/20170320024649/http://www.smallfarmcentral.com/Blog-Item-CSA-We-have-a-Problem))



Agrico Leipzig = wants to do different / more efficient



## Goals / Objectives

Participants

- healthy food
  - certain amount of produce every week
  - follows health guidelines
- sustainable harvest
  - no industrial agriculture
  - low amount of pesticies / chemicals
- ease of use
  - weekly delivery to drop off point
  - less normal shopping for other groceries
- connection to nature



Farmers

- Risk Sharing
  - lower risk of weather / harvest
- Work in Harvest at Farm
- better pay
- safety net



both: connectedness to other + community of others

## Environment

Society

- wishes for sustainable food production
- in accordance with nature / not industrial
- accustomed to prices / constant availablity of big customers



Food market

- industrial agriculture: short term efficient + cheap
- monopolization of intermediaries (supermarket chains)
- trade relations global for all types of products



AgriCo

- focus on type of consumers that have different needs
- be transparent about the types of products on offer
- location: just outside of leipzig (main city)





## Participants

farmers

- responsible for the work on the farm
- ca 10-15 people to manage everything (full time)
- allrounder people (many types of produce + leading)



Co-Farmers

- other sustainable farms around
- sell produce not sold to be added to the shares
- common goal of sustainability
- increase diversity of shares 



Consumers

- ca 700, max 1000 (not more)
  - keep in a community size
  - but not too small to have variety of crops
  - differs from typical enterprises in capitalist economies (only grow)
- diverse backgrounds
  - comon: bourgeois boheme with enough money, families
  - also focus on other backgrounds: 
    - migrants with language barrier
    - flatshares of young people (future high-income customers)
    - pensioners (have a lot of time + experience)
  - Why: build more of a communtiy feeling than just the same people in the same room every time
  - reduces group dynamics of customers
    - e.g richer people making unmeetable demands
    - make CSA more generalisable to whole society 

- Common goal of good produce
- Willingness / knwoing about need to help in harvest season
  - incentive scheme (not a financial, but social)
  - more interesting fruits in harvest
  - symbolic rewards
- take part in voting of coop (once a year)
- live close by to drop off point
- acceptance of "surprise / diversity" in share box



## Social Structure

- flat hierarchy 
  - between workers at farm
  - and between farm + community (but less so)
    - farmers = more information about situation
- information sharing at plenary
  - create common aim / goal of the coop
  - interweave members / farmers
  - higher effiency if ifno is shared widely (but condensed)
- equal votes in coop (1 human = 1 vote)
  - Comp to 1$ 1 vote in market hierarchy
- exploitation problem of farmers (feel indebted to consumers)
  - limit with strict time control
  - incentive structure against consumers
  - good pay
- community feeling 
  - not just work on farm
  - also farm visits for children /  families etc
  - communication regularly ([ATTRA 2019](https://attradev.ncat.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/community-supported-agriculture.pdf))
    - recipes tailored to share
    - inside views of the farm
    - = decrease retention rate
  - increases retention rate (know what to do with the produce)

=> valuable feeling for everyone, collaboration instead of exploitation

=> common goal / movement of the coop



## Financials

problem: cost of organic farming = higher than conventional

- more work + more expensive inputs

AgriCo:

- EU subsidies
- work requirements from consumers
- cheap land from state
  - advantage: position Leipzig
  - Former Eastern Germany: state owned enterprises
  - land partly now in state BVVG
  - primarily to ecological / small enterprises 
  - lower rent
- direct share system = no risk for farmers
  - no insurance against weather events
- yearly payments (in advance)
- solidaric prices
  - richer consumers pay more
  - subsidizing for lower income groups
  - balanced consumer group 



> The idea is to hyper-personalize the marketing
> process and not just be running numbers and
> spreadsheets. Marketing a CSA needs to be
> deeply personal—CSA’s greatest strength is the

following Mintzberg Classification: Adhocracy / Missionare

-  partly ideological = not rely on market
- mission driven
- simple systems and small size



## Conclusion

given problems

- partially adressed
- in the end: often a money problem
  - more diversity = more costly
  - or needs a larger base of customers
- subsidies play important role 
  - landscape is quite good in Germany for eco
- needs the right type of customers (can be educated or selected)



CSA = not the solution to all problems in food / agriculture

- individualistic solution
- not generalisable to whole population
  - buy a lot of stuff next to the produce of farms
  - size of shares only for bigger HHs
- but for participants / farmers = advantageous
