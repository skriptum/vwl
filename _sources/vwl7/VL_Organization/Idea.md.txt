Solawi: Solidaric Agricultural Cooperative

- worker owned
- sell their produce as a subscription 
 - direct marketing
 - based on what is harvested
- bio, ethical, fair
- subscribers have work days on the field



1. How is it Produced? Fair + bio
2. Who produces? Workers + Subscribers
3. How is it sold? As a share of harvest (e.g 1/100th); not a fixed amount

Problem: Burn Out & low engagement & attrition



Organizational Structure with Incentives that align 
- motivate people to spend time 
- preserve the culture
- which connections to which stakeholders (other farmers, subscribers, workers)


Idea: 
- farmers for other types of produce
- coop in other parts of the world
- flexibility
