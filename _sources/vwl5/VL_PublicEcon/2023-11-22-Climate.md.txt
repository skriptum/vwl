Climate Change = prime example for Externality

Solution: => internalize the externaltiy

## Carbon Taxes

government induced tax on emissions

- implemented in Germany, Sweden, Norway ...
- often not sufficient
- distributional effects (*Gelbwesten*) => Climate Bonus (*Klimageld*)

## Cap and Trade

- Cap = upper limit on emissions
- Trade = trading of bought certificates

=> efficient production

- often price not high enough
- high variance in prices => investment not secure



## Cost-Benefit Analysis

> **Social Cost of Carbon:** economic damage done by CO2t emission

dependent on:

- damage function
- discount rates

Discount Rates

$$
i = z + n \times g
$$

- z = time preference (UBA = 0)
- n = percent change utility for 1% increase consumption
- g = growth consumption
