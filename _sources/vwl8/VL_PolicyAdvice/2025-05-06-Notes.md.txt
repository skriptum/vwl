Overview Article: @coatesEconomistsReachConclusion2008 = no impact

Economic Intuition

- Fixed budget for sports on consumer level
  - spent on other events if not football
  - subsitution



all this: Supply Side of professional clubs

other: Demand Side 

- income from extraregional to regional
- propensity to regional consumption relevant



paper is well situated in its research avenue among the exisiting literature

- method is well thought out (SCM is typical)
- novel research (football pro leagues)
  - literature is mostly american until now
- applicable to other sports leagues too
  - with similar function (relegation etc)
  - mostly european style tournaments

The paper is well situated within the broader academic discourse on the economic effects of professional sports franchises. The overview study by @coatesEconomistsReachConclusion2008 concludes that there is little to no evidence supporting substantial positive economic effects of professional sports teams or stadiums that would warrant public subsidies. On a supraregional level, these effects appear to be largely a zero-sum game.

Empirical studies on the regional economic impact of sports franchises yield mixed but generally modest findings. For instance, @baadeBigMenCampus2011 reports small positive effects from university sports leagues in Florida. In contrast, @feddersenSectoralLabourMarket2012, studying the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany, finds that while the hospitality sector experienced positive short-term effects, the construction sector saw negative impacts. @coatesEconomicConsequencesProfessional2001 investigates sports strikes in the NBA and concludes that such disruptions had no significant economic consequences. Similarly, @stormTheyMakeDifference2017 shows that professional sports leagues in Denmark had only very small effects on specific sectors of the economy.

These findings underscore a key economic intuition: consumers operate under a fixed budget for leisure and sports expenditures. When professional football is unavailable or less attractive (e.g., due to relegation), this spending is often reallocated to other activities—a classic case of the substitution effect. As a result, any economic impact tends to be temporally, sectorally, and geographically bounded.

Much of the literature focuses on the supply side of sports economics, assessing how the presence or absence of clubs or events affects local economies. However, the demand side—particularly the inflow of income from extra-regional sources and the marginal propensity to consume locally—also plays a critical role. This dimension is emphasized in the present study, especially in its identification of professional clubs as potential export-base sectors. 

To summarize, the paper by Brachert is methodologically rigorous, employing a regression discontinuity design (RDD), a credible alternative to the synthetic control method (SCM) commonly used in the literature. The focus on European professional football leagues represents a novel contribution, as much of the existing empirical literature concentrates on American sports contexts. Furthermore, the study's findings may be generalizable to other professional leagues with similar institutional structures (e.g., promotion and relegation systems), particularly within European sporting models.

### Data

Paper: uses valid data sources

- from 1995 - 2012
- NUTS 3 Level regional economic data
  - problem: broad categories of sectors
  - only focused on: G-K: Wholesale, Retail, Accommodation,...

- 16 seasons, four leagues (Italy, Fracne, Germany, UK)
- attendance Data: http://european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn.htm
  - data sources of this website not revealed
  - not official statistics, consumer collected
  - often used in research, e.g. @buraimoImpactsGreatRecession2022





Problems

- regions with multiple clubs
- Difference between Treated and Non Treated Groups
  - solved via dynamic cutoff around relegation
  - BW of +-6 points around 
  - calculated with

The study utilizes valid and credible data sources covering the period from 1995 to 2012. Regional economic indicators are drawn from the Cambridge Econometrics European Regional Database at the NUTS-3 level, offering the most disaggregated regional economic data available for the European context. However, one limitation arises from the sectoral resolution of the data: the analysis is constrained to broad economic categories, particularly sectors G–K (wholesale, retail, transport, accommodation, food services, information, and communication). This limits the precision of the sector-specific interpretation of football-related economic effects.

The analysis spans 16 seasons and covers four major European football leagues: Italy’s Serie A, France’s Ligue 1, Germany’s Bundesliga, and the English Premier League. Attendance data at the club level are sourced from European Football Statistics, a well-known but non-official repository of spectator data. While the website does not disclose its data sources, it compiles information from fan-based and publicly reported figures. Despite its informal nature, the dataset has been widely used in prior academic research (e.g., @buraimoImpactsGreatRecession2022), lending it some degree of scholarly acceptance.

Some methodological challenges emerge from the structure of the data. First, the presence of multiple clubs within a single NUTS-3 region can complicate attribution of regional effects. Second, and more importantly, the treatment assignment in the regression discontinuity design (RDD) varies due to the nature of relegation thresholds. To address this, the author defines treatment dynamically based on the point differential to the first non-relegation rank. A local bandwidth of approximately ±6 points around the cutoff is applied, which is determined through a data-driven procedure using the method from @calonicoRobustDataDrivenInference2014. This approach enables credible causal inference but results in varying sample sizes and compositions across different model specifications.

### Results

Hypotheses 1: confirmed with Regression

- Variable to Test: Attendance at Game
- 28% decrease
- but is this a valid Variable for Club Income?
  - no specific data on this on club level
  - but especially in germany: a lot of clubs in second league that have more visitors than first
  - due to famous clubs in 2nd (HSV, BSC, etc)
- and corporate clubs without many fans in 1st (RBL)
- differential effects in different countries?
  - not transparent in the analysis that some may have heavier effect than others




Figure 3 from Paper



Hypotheses 2: confirmed

- regional GVA
- very broad categories of economic sectors 
- not as statistically significant as before
- 3% reduction in sectors in relegated regions



Hypotheses 3: partially confirmed

- no relevant regional growth effects 
- but employment effects (p only 0.1 = statistical superfluous)
  - at least in the short term tested here
  - limited statististical significance






Limitations

- Overfitting of Polynomial 4 to show a cutoff (esp H2 Figure)
  - @gelmanWhyHighOrderPolynomials2019
  - only visual element

- Bandwidth around Cutoff changes in every regression
  - due to R package @calonicoRobustDataDrivenInference2014 *rdrobust*
  - automatically calculated
  - comparing treated and control group of before 
  - does not apply in every case then
  - leads to different numbers of treated / non treated in every hypothesis tested
  - Example:
    - change absolute attendance (table 3): 
      - observations 74 | 299
      - BW: 4.6, 4.6

    - change relative attendance
      - observations: 101 | 397
      - BW. 6.3 | 6.3

  - = incosisten sample sizes

The first hypothesis—that relegation negatively affects the income level of a football club—is empirically confirmed using a regression discontinuity design. The proxy variable employed is average attendance at home games, which shows a significant decline of approximately 28% in the season following relegation. This result is interpreted as a strong indicator of lost revenue and diminished club relevance.

However, the validity of attendance as a proxy for club income is debatable. Detailed financial data at the club level are not available, and attendance figures may not directly correlate with actual income. In the German context, for example, several clubs in the second division (e.g., HSV, Hertha BSC) attract more spectators than some top-division teams (e.g., RB Leipzig), due to historical fan base size and regional significance. This casts doubt on the assumption that relegation uniformly leads to lower match-day income.

Furthermore, the analysis does not differentiate between national contexts, despite the likelihood of differential effects across leagues. Institutional and fan culture differences between Germany, France, Italy, and the UK may influence how relegation impacts attendance and, by extension, revenue. The paper would benefit from a more granular country-level assessment to clarify potential heterogeneity in treatment effects.

Hypothesis 2, which posits a negative effect of relegation on football-related sectors in the regional economy, is confirmed by the analysis. The study finds an average reduction of approximately 3% in gross value added (GVA) within the wholesale, retail, accommodation, and transport sectors of relegated regions. However, the categories used are broad and encompass a wide range of activities not directly tied to football. This aggregation limits the precision of the findings. Moreover, while the results are statistically significant, they are not as robust as those related to attendance, suggesting a weaker but still present sectoral impact.

Hypothesis 3—that relegation affects overall regional development—is only partially supported. The analysis does not detect any significant effect on regional GVA growth. However, a small negative effect on employment is observed, with a p-value of 0.1. This level of statistical significance is weak and suggests only a marginal impact, particularly in the short term examined by the study. Consequently, while relegation appears to influence specific sectors, its broader economic consequences at the regional level remain limited and statistically inconclusive.

The results, while methodologically robust in many respects, exhibits several limitations that affect the interpretability and comparability of its findings. First, the use of a fourth-degree polynomial to visualize the regression discontinuity (RD) cutoff—particularly in figures supporting Hypothesis 2—raises concerns about potential overfitting. As noted by @gelmanWhyHighOrderPolynomials2019, high-order polynomials can exaggerate discontinuities and introduce misleading curvature, especially in RD contexts. Although these fits are used only for visualization, they may still bias the reader’s perception of treatment effects.

Second, the bandwidth around the cutoff varies across regressions due to the use of the rdrobust package, which employs the data-driven procedure outlined in @calonicoRobustDataDrivenInference2014. While this approach optimizes bandwidth to minimize mean squared error, it also introduces inconsistency: each hypothesis test is estimated on different subsamples, with varying numbers of treated and control units. For instance, the model estimating the change in absolute attendance (Table 3) uses 74 treated and 299 control observations with a bandwidth of 4.6 points, whereas the relative attendance model includes 101 treated and 397 control observations within a 6.3-point bandwidth. This variation leads to inconsistent sample sizes and potentially limits the comparability of results across hypotheses.

In sum, while the paper applies appropriate and widely accepted RDD techniques, the combination of visual overfitting and inconsistent sample definitions across tests calls for cautious interpretation. Greater transparency in modeling choices and robustness checks using fixed or common bandwidths could strengthen the reliability and comparability of the reported effects.

- innovative idea of relegation cutoff
- confirms the prevoius research
  - onl secotrally, temporally and regionally effects of relegations
- regions should keep these in mind, but not worry about it
- politically: subsidization of sports club criticise
  - e.g free police in stadiums in germany
  - even though a lot of costs incurred by this
  - see discussion @mauseFussballspielePolizeieinsaetzeUnd2020

SMS Level 4: RDD

Requirements

- Cutoff sufficiently sharp :white_check_mark:
- only treatment changes at the boundary :ballot_box_with_check:
- no manipulation around cut off :white_check_mark:

= Level 4

- RDD: higher than other econometric methods
- only below the gold standard of RCT

The study employs a regression discontinuity design (RDD), which qualifies as Level 4 on the Scientific Methods Scale (SMS) for causal inference—just below randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The cutoff used is sharp and exogenous, treatment assignment changes discontinuously, and there is no evidence of manipulation around the threshold. These features lend credibility to the causal claims made, placing the study above standard observational approaches in methodological rigor.

Beyond its methodological strength, the study makes a substantive contribution to the literature on the economic effects of professional sports franchises. It introduces the innovative idea of using relegation thresholds as a natural experiment and provides new evidence on the consequences of relegation. The findings confirm existing research: economic effects are largely sectoral, short-term, and geographically limited. Policymakers should take note of these findings, but they do not justify major concern or policy intervention.

In particular, the study casts doubt on the rationale for public subsidization of professional sports clubs, especially in cases where public resources are used without clear economic returns—for example, the provision of free policing at stadiums in Germany, despite significant public costs. This debate has been critically discussed, e.g., by @mauseFussballspielePolizeieinsaetzeUnd2020. While the study’s empirical framework is not without weaknesses—such as data limitations and sample inconsistencies—it nonetheless offers a novel and well-founded contribution to the evidence base on sports and regional policy.
